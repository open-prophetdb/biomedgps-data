### Symptom Ontology

Description: The symptom ontology was designed around the guiding concept of a symptom being: "A perceived change in function, sensation or appearance reported by a patient indicative of a disease". Understanding the close relationship of Signs and Symptoms, where Signs are the objective observation of an illness, the Symptom Ontology will work to broaden itâ€™s scope to capture and document in a more robust manor these two sets of terms. Understanding that at times, the same term may be both a Sign and a Symptom.
