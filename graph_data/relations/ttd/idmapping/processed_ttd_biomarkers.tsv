HALT-C enrolled patients with advanced liver disease (Ishak fibrosis score aY3) in two phases: a lead-in to establish lack of sustained viral response with ful l dose pegylated interferon (IFN) and ribavirin followed by a 3.5-year randomize d trial with low-dose IFN. Low-dose IFN did not prevent liver disease progressio n, and patients were then followed for up to an additional 5 years off therapy.	Analyses were performed for 1,319 patients who had GGT measured prior to initiat ion of treatment. Increases in risk with each increase in quintile of GGT (10-57 , 58-89, 90-139, 140-230, 231-2,000 IU/L) were determined by logistic regression for treatment response or Cox regression for clinical outcomes. Baseline GGT w as associated with male sex, nonwhite ethnicity, diabetes and insulin resistance , interleukin (IL)28B rs12979860 CT and TT genotypes, and numerous markers of li ver disease injury and severity. In the lead-in phase, increasing GGT was strong ly associated with diminished week 20 response, end of treatment response, and s ustained virological response in both univariate and multivariate analyses contr olling for factors known to be associated with treatment response (P < 0.0001). GGT was also associated with all clinical outcomes in univariate and multivariat e analysis (P < 0.05) except for hepatocellular carcinoma (P = 0.46 in multivari ate analysis).

Clinical trial	More frequent dialysis may improve nutrition and remove dietary restrictions in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We present results from a trial comparing nutritiona l parameters between nocturnal hemodialysis (NHD) and conventional HD patients.	Patients were randomized to conventional thrice weekly HD or NHD for a 6-month s tudy period. Dietary intake was recorded by patients using a 3-day food record a t baseline and study exit.	Of 51 patients, 23 completed baseline and exit food records and were included in the analysis. Although dietary intake of calcium, potassium, and lipids increas ed in the NHD group, serum levels of calcium and potassium remained within targe t limits. The majority of NHD subjects were able to reduce or discontinue their phosphate binders and maintain serum phosphate levels within target limits. Seru m albumin improved among the NHD group (0.7 g/L) and declined for the convention al group (-1.6 g/L). None of the between group differences achieved statistical significance.

Of 51 patients, 23 completed baseline and exit food records and were included in the analysis. Although dietary intake of calcium, potassium, and lipids increas ed in the NHD group, serum levels of calcium and potassium remained within targe t limits. The majority of NHD subjects were able to reduce or discontinue their phosphate binders and maintain serum phosphate levels within target limits. Seru m albumin improved among the NHD group (0.7 g/L) and declined for the convention al group (-1.6 g/L). None of the between group differences achieved statistical significance.

Toxicity	Gene polymorphism		fluorouracil; irinotecan + fluorouracil ; oxaliplatin + fluorouracil		Clinical trial	Predicting efficacy and toxicity could potentially allow individualization of ca ncer therapy. We investigated putative pharmacogeneticmarkers of chemotherapy to xicity in a large randomized trial.	Patients were randomly assigned to different sequences of chemotherapy for advan ced colorectal cancer. First-line therapy was fluorouracil (FU), irinotecan/FU ( IrFU) or oxaliplatin/FU (OxFU). Patients allocated first-line FU had planned sec ond-line irinotecan alone, IrFU, or OxFU. The primary toxicity outcome measure w as toxicity-induced delay or dose reduction; the secondary outcome was Common Te rminology Criteria of Adverse Events grade >or= 3 toxicity. DNA was analyzed in 1,188 patients; 1,036 were assessable for the primary outcome, including 688 tre ated with FU, 270 with IrFU (first or second line), 280 with OxFU (first or seco nd line), 184 with irinotecan alone, and 454 with any irinotecan-containing regi men. Ten polymorphisms were assessed: thymidylate synthase-enhancer region (TYMS -ER), thymidylate synthase 1494 (TYMS-1494), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DP YD), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), mutL homolog 1 (MLH1), UDP glu curonyltransferase (UGT1A1), ATP-binding cassette group B gene 1 (ABCB1), x-ray cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1), glutathione-S-transferase P1 (GSTP1), and e xcision repair cross-complementing gene 2 (ERCC2).	Using the primary outcome measure, no polymorphism was significantly associated (P < .01) with the toxicity of any regimen or with the difference in toxicity of IrFU or OxFU versus FU alone. Trends (of doubtful significance) were seen for a ssociations of XRCC1, ERCC2, and GSTP1 with toxicity during irinotecan regimens: XRCC1, primary end point, any irinotecan-containing regimen (P = .045); ERCC2, secondary end point, irinotecan alone (P = .003); GSTP1, secondary end point; Ir FU (P = .039); and irinotecan alone (P = .05). There was no evidence of associat ion of UGT1A1*28 with irinotecan toxicity.

The use of serial alpha-fe toprotein (AFP) in monitoring response has not been rigorously evaluated. We aim ed to study the clinical value of AFP trend in an attempt to validate AFP as a s urrogate serologic end point.	Participants from a phase III randomized trial of systemic chemotherapy in HCC w ere studied. Serum AFP was prospectively collected in parallel with clinical and radiologic outcome. AFP response was defined as a decrease in AFP of more than 20% after a minimum of two cycles of chemotherapy. We studied the relationship b etween AFP response and treatment outcome in terms of radiologic response and ov erall survival.	Of 188 patients, 117 patients with elevated serum AFP (> 20 microg/L) and docume nted radiologic evaluation had received at least two cycles of chemotherapy. A t otal of 47 AFP responders were identified. AFP responders had better survival th an nonresponders (13.5 v 5.6 months, respectively; P < .0001), and AFP response was strongly associated with radiologic response (P < .0001). Multivariate analy sis suggested that AFP response was significantly associated with survival (haza rd ratio, 0.413; 95% CI, 0.273 to 0.626; P < .0001). AFP responses were frequent ly observed in patients with radiologically stable disease (SD) and tended to id entify a subgroup of SD patients with better survival.

The clinical activity of IFN- I is thought to be mediated not only by anti-proliferative effects, but also by induction and modulation of secondary cytokines. We examined serum cytokine lev els in IFN-I-treated patients to find potential biological markers for response or toxicity.	In a prospective randomized trial, 66 stages II and III melanoma patients underw ent an induction treatment of 10 MU IFN I2b s.c. 5 /week, followed by either 5 MU or 10 MU IFN I2b s.c. 3 /week for a total of 2 years. Serial measurement s of serum IL-1I, IL-2, sIL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-I and I-2 microglobulin (B2M ) were taken. Two factorial analysis of repeated measurements (ANOVA) as well as univariate and multivariate analyses was used to identify prognostic factors fo r relapse and toxicity.	TNF-I levels correlated with toxicity. In patients with relapse, significantly lower levels of TNF-I were detected at baseline and throughout therapy compared with patients without relapse. B2M and sIL-2R showed a significant increase thr oughout the therapy phase. At baseline, the combination of TNF-I, B2M and sIL-2 R revealed a positive predictive value for relapse of 82.9% in the multivariate analyses.

Clinical trial	To determine the clinical utility of intrinsic molecular phenotype after breast- conserving therapy (BCT) with lumpectomy and whole-breast irradiation with or wi thout a cavityboost.	Four hundred ninety-eight patients with invasive breast cancer were enrolled int o a randomized trial of BCT with or without a tumor bed radiation boost. Tumors were classified by intrinsic molecular phenotype as luminal A or B, HER-2, basal -like, or unclassified using a five-biomarker panel: estrogen receptor, progeste rone receptor, HER-2, CK5/6, and epidermal growth factor receptor. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards methodology were used to ascertain relationships to ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), locoregional recurrence (LRR), dist ant disease-free survival (DDFS), and death from breast cancer.	Median follow-up was 84 months. Three hundred ninety-four patients were classifi ed as luminal A, 23 were luminal B, 52 were basal, 13 were HER-2, and 16 were un classified. There were 24 IBTR (4.8%), 35 LRR (7%), 47 distant metastases (9.4%) , and 37 breast cancer deaths (7.4%). The overall 5-year disease-free rates for the whole cohort were: IBTR 97.4%, LRR 95.6%, DDFS 92.9%, and breast cancer-spec ific death 96.3%. A significant difference was observed for survival between sub types for LRR (P = .012), DDFS (P = .0035), and breast cancer-specific death (P = .0482), but not for IBTR (P = .346).

We compared the pCR rates aft er T/FAC versus FACx6 preoperative chemotherapy. We also did an exploratory anal ysis to identify novel candidate genes that differentially predict response in t he two treatment arms.	Two hundred and seventy-three patients were randomly assigned to receive either weekly paclitaxel 12 followed by FAC 4 (T/FAC, n = 138), or FAC 6 (n = 135) neoadjuvant chemotherapy. All patients underwent a pretreatment fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the tumor for gene expression profiling and treatment resp onse prediction.	The pCR rates were 19% and 9% in the T/FAC and FAC arms, respectively (P < 0.05) . In the T/FAC arm, the positive predictive value (PPV) of the genomic predictor was 38% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 21-56%], the negative predictive val ue was 88% (95% CI, 77-95%), and the area under the receiver operating character istic curve (AUC) was 0.711. In the FAC arm, the PPV was 9% (95% CI, 1-29%) and the AUC was 0.584. This suggests thatthe genomic predictor may have regimen spe cificity. Its performance was similar to a clinical variable-based predictor nom ogram.

Survival; clinical outcome	Protein		polyestradiol phosphate; total androgen blockade		Clinical trial	We determined how serial measurements of prostate specific antigen and alkaline phosphatase can be used to predict survival early in the course of hormone treat ed metastatic prostate cancer	The study was based on a prospective randomized trial of 915 patients with metas tatic prostate carcinoma designed to compare parenteral estrogen (polyestradiol phosphate) vs total androgen blockade. We included 697 men who survived at least 6 months and had complete serial measurements of prostate specific antigen and alkaline phosphatase. Six models were constructed based on prostate specific ant igen and alkaline phosphatase at start, and after 6 months of treatment, alkalin e phosphatase flare and relative prostate specific antigen velocity. We construc ted time dependent receiver operating characteristic curves with corresponding a rea under the curve to predict death from prostate cancer within 3 years	The best variables to predict outcome were alkaline phosphatase at 6 months (AUC 0.79 for polyestradiol phosphate and 0.72 for total androgen blockade), alkalin e phosphatase at baseline (AUC 0.70 for polyestradiol phosphate and total androg en blockade) and prostate specific antigen at 6 months (AUC 0.70 for polyestradi ol phosphate and total androgen blockade). Prostate specific antigen and alkalin e phosphatase levels 6 months after start of treatment give better prediction of survival than baseline levels

Phase II	This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging phase 2 study ex plored safety, efficacy, and biomarker effects of ELND005 (an oral amyloid anti- aggregation agent) in mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD).	A total of 353 patients were randomized to ELND005 (250, 1,000, or 2,000 mg) or placebo twice daily for 78 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were the Neuropsychologica l Test Battery (NTB) and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Dai ly Living (ADCS-ADL) scale. The primary analysis compared 250 mg (n =84) to plac ebo (n =82) after an imbalance of infections and deaths led to early discontinua tion of the 2 higher dose groups.	The 250 mg dose demonstrated acceptable safety. The primary efficacy analysis at 78 weeks revealed no significant differences between the treatment groups on th e NTB or ADCS-ADL. Brain ventricular volume showed a small but significant incre ase in the overall 250 mg group (p =0.049). At the 250 mg dose,scyllo-inositol concentrations increased in CSF and brain and CSF AIx-42 was decreased signific antly compared to placebo (p =0.009).

Point-of-care genetic testing for personalisation of antiplatelet treatment (RAPID GENE): a prospective, randomised, proof-of-concept trial. Lancet. 2012 May 5;379(9827):1705-11.		Increased adverse cardiovascular events	Global: measure				Clinical trial	To use a novel point-of-care genetic test to identify carriers of the CYP2C19*2 allele and aimed to assess a pharmacogenetic approach to dual antiplatelet treat ment after PCI.	Between Aug 26, 2010, and July 7, 2011, 200 patients were enrolled into our pros pective, randomised, proof-of-concept study. Patients undergoing PCI for acute c oronary syndrome or stable anginawere randomly assigned to rapid point-of-care genotyping or to standard treatment. Individuals in the rapid genotyping group w ere screened for the CYP2C19*2 allele. Carriers were given 10 mg prasugrel daily , and non-carriers and patients in the standard treatment group were given 75 mg clopidogrel daily. The primary endpoint was the proportion of CYP2C19*2 carrier s with high on-treatment platelet reactivity (P2Y12 reactivity unit [PRU] value of more than 234) after 1 week of dual antiplatelet treatment, which is a marker associated with increased adverse cardiovascular events. Interventional cardiol ogists and data analysts were masked to genetic status and treatment. Patients w ere not masked to treatment allocation. All analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01184300.	After randomisation, 187 patients completed follow-up (91 rapid genotyping group , 96 standard treatment). 23 individuals in each group carried at least one CYP2 C19*2 allele. None of the 23 carriers in the rapid genotyping group had a PRU va lue of more than 234 at day 7, compared with seven (30%) given standard treatmen t (p=0a0092). The point-of-care genetic test had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 92a3-100) and a specificity of 99a3% (96a3-100).

Le vels were elevated in stable disease and even further during exacerbation. Notab ly, baseline levels were related to subsequent severity and disease progression, particularly in emphysema [27]. This biomarker is likely to be measuring neutro phil- mediated lung tissue destruction, so its specificity for COPD is open to q uestion.

The clinical activity of IFN- I is thought to be mediated not only by anti-proliferative effects, but also by induction and modulation of secondary cytokines. We examined serum cytokine lev els in IFN-I-treated patients to find potential biological markers for response or toxicity.	In a prospective randomized trial, 66 stages II and III melanoma patients underw ent an induction treatment of 10 MU IFN I2b s.c. 5 /week, followed by either 5 MU or 10 MU IFN I2b s.c. 3 /week for a total of 2 years. Serial measurement s of serum IL-1I, IL-2, sIL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-I and I-2 microglobulin (B2M ) were taken. Two factorial analysis of repeated measurements (ANOVA) as well as univariate and multivariate analyses was used to identify prognostic factors fo r relapse and toxicity.	TNF-I levels correlated with toxicity. In patients with relapse, significantly lower levels of TNF-I were detected at baseline and throughout therapy compared with patients without relapse. B2M and sIL-2R showed a significant increase thr oughout the therapy phase. At baseline, the combination of TNF-I, B2M and sIL-2 R revealed a positive predictive value for relapse of 82.9% in the multivariate analyses.

Reduced the combined rates of LV systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, an d heart failure; adverse events; reduced	Smallmolecule	At least 1 BNP reading of 50 pg/mL or higher			Phase IV	To determine the efficacy of a screening program using brain-type natriuretic pe ptide (BNP) and collaborative care in an at-risk population in reducing newly di agnosed heart failure and prevalence of significant left ventricular (LV) systol ic and/or diastolic dysfunction.	The St Vincent's Screening to Prevent Heart Failure Study, a parallel-group rand omized trial involving 1374 participants with cardiovascular risk factors (mean age, 64.8 [SD, 10.2] years) recruited from 39 primary care practices in Ireland between January 2005 and December 2009 and followed up until December 2011 (mean follow-up, 4.2 [SD, 1.2] years). Patients were randomly assigned to receive usu al primary care (control condition; n=677) or screening with BNP testing (n=697) . Intervention-group participants with BNP levels of 50 pg/mL or higher underwen t echocardiography and collaborative care between their primary care physician a nd specialist cardiovascular service. The primary end point was prevalence of as ymptomatic LV dysfunction with or without newly diagnosed heart failure. Seconda ry end points included emergency hospitalization for arrhythmia, transient ische mic attack, stroke, myocardial infarction, peripheral or pulmonary thrombosis/em bolus, or heart failure.	A total of 263 patients (41.6%) in the intervention group had at least 1 BNP rea ding of 50 pg/mL or higher. The intervention group underwent more cardiovascular investigations (control, 496 per 1000 patient-years vs intervention, 850 per 10 00 patient-years; incidence rate ratio, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.61-1.83; P<.001) and rec eived more renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system-based therapy at follow-up (cont rol, 49.6%; intervention, 56.5%; P=.01). The primary end point of LV dysfunction with or without heart failure was met in 59 (8.7%) of 677 in the control group and 37 (5.3%) of 697 in the intervention group (odds ratio [OR], 0.55; 95% CI, 0 .37-0.82; Pa=a.003). Asymptomatic LV dysfunction was found in 45 (6.6%) of 6 77 control-group patients and 30 (4.3%) of 697 intervention-group patients (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37-0.88; Pa=a.01). Heart failure occurred in 14 (2.1%) of 67 7 control-group patients and 7 (1.0%) of 697 intervention-group patients (OR, 0. 48; 95% CI, 0.20-1.20; Pa=a.12). The incidence rates of emergency hospitaliz ation for major cardiovascular events were 40.4 per 1000 patient-years in the co ntrol group vs 22.3 per 1000 patient-years in the intervention group (incidence rate ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45-0.81; Pa=a.002).

Between Aug 26, 2010, and July 7, 2011, 200 patients were enrolled into our pros pective, randomised, proof-of-concept study. Patients undergoing PCI for acute c oronary syndrome or stable anginawere randomly assigned to rapid point-of-care genotyping or to standard treatment. Individuals in the rapid genotyping group w ere screened for the CYP2C19*2 allele. Carriers were given 10 mg prasugrel daily , and non-carriers and patients in the standard treatment group were given 75 mg clopidogrel daily. The primary endpoint was the proportion of CYP2C19*2 carrier s with high on-treatment platelet reactivity (P2Y12 reactivity unit [PRU] value of more than 234) after 1 week of dual antiplatelet treatment, which is a marker associated with increased adverse cardiovascular events. Interventional cardiol ogists and data analysts were masked to genetic status and treatment. Patients w ere not masked to treatment allocation. All analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01184300.	After randomisation, 187 patients completed follow-up (91 rapid genotyping group , 96 standard treatment). 23 individuals in each group carried at least one CYP2 C19*2 allele. None of the 23 carriers in the rapid genotyping group had a PRU va lue of more than 234 at day 7, compared with seven (30%) given standard treatmen t (p=0a0092). The point-of-care genetic test had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 92a3-100) and a specificity of 99a3% (96a3-100).

Positive P48 expression was graded as >/=20% positive cells in 1 sample.	Eighty-one patients were positive for P48,and 74 patients were negative for P48 . The clinicopathologic data were comparable between patients with P48-negative and P48-positive staining. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in P48-positive patients were better than that in P48-negative patients in Grou p 1 (DFS, P = .036; OS, P = .014), however, DFS and OS did not differ between pa tients with positive and negative P48 in Group 2. OS in P48-positive patients fr om Group 1 was better than that in patients with P48-positive patients from Grou p 2 (OS, P = .001) but did not differ when P48 was negative. In Group 1, the ris k factors for DFS were cirrhosis and P48 staining, and the risk factors for OS w ere tumor differentiation and P48 staining. Receiver operating curve analysis in dicated that, in the first 2 yearsof DFS, combined cirrhosis and P48 had good p redictive accuracy; and, in the first 4 years of OS, combined tumor differentiat ion and P48 had good predictive accuracy.

Excision repair cross-compl ementing 1 (ERCC1) has been associated with cisplatin resistance. We hypothesize d that assigning cisplatin based on pretreatment ERCC1 mRNA levels would improve response	From August 2001 to October 2005, 444 stage IV NSCLC patients were enrolled. RNA was isolated from pretreatment biopsies, and quantitative real-time reverse tra nscriptase PCR assays were performed to determine ERCC1 mRNA expression. Patient s were randomly assigned in a 1:2 ratio to either the control or genotypic arm b efore ERCC1 assessment. Patients in the control arm received docetaxel plus cisp latin. In the genotypic arm, patients with low ERCC1 levels received docetaxel p lus cisplatin, and those with high levels received docetaxel plus gemcitabine. T he primary end point was the overall objective response rate	Of 444 patients enrolled, 78 (17.6%) went off study before receiving one cycle o f chemotherapy, mainly due to insufficient tumor tissue for ERCC1 mRNA assessmen t. Of the remaining 346 patients assessable for response, objective response was attained by 53 patients (39.3%) in the control arm and 107 patients (50.7%) in the genotypic arm (P = .02).

The candidate biomarkers were: tumor immunohistochemistry for MLH1/MSH2, p53, to poisomerase-1 (Topo1), excision repair cross-complementing gene 1 (ERCC1), O-6-m ethylguanine-DNA-methyltranserase (MGMT), and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2); germline DNA polymorphisms in GSTP1, ABCB1, XRCC1, ERCC2, and UGT1A1. These were screened in more than 750 patients for interaction with benefit from irinotecan or oxali platin; two markers (Topo1 and MLH1/MSH2) met criteria to be taken forward for a nalysis in the full population. Primary end points were progression-free surviva l (PFS) and overall survival.	One thousand three hundred thirteen patients(81%) were assessable for Topo1 imm unohistochemistry (low, < 10%; moderate, 10% to 50%; or high, > 50% tumor nuclei ). In patients with low Topo1, PFS was not improved by the addition of either ir inotecan (hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.22) or oxaliplatin (HR, 0.8 5; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.07); conversely, patients with moderate/high Topo1 benefite d from the addition of either drug (HR,0.48 to 0.70 in all categories; interact ion P = .005; overall, P = .001 for irinotecan; P = .05 for oxaliplatin). High T opo1 was associated with a major overall survival benefit with first-line combin ation chemotherapy (HR, 0.60; median benefit, 5.3 months); patients with moderat e or low Topo1 did not benefit (HR, 0.92 and 1.09, respectively; interaction P = .005). MLH1/MSH2 did not show significant interaction with treatment, although the low rate of loss (4.4%) limits the power of the study for this biomarker

Shed ECD in serum has been studied as both prognostic and predictive marker s. Lapatinib is a dual inhibitor of HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor ki nases. We examined the prognostic and predictive role of HER2 ECD in a randomize d trial of paclitaxel with placebo or lapatinib in women with HER2-negative or - unknown breast cancer.	Patients (n = 579) with newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer (MBC) were rand omly assigned to paclitaxel with placebo or lapatinib. HER2 status was determine d centrally. ECD was centrally measured by enzyme linked immunoassay in availabl e samples at baseline (b; n = 472), week 9, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Resul ts were correlated to overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS).	Elevated baseline ECD (bECD) levels (>or= 16 ng/mL) did not predict HER2 tumor s tatus (sensitivity, 62%; specificity, 75%). In HER2-negative tumors, elevated bE CD was not correlated with improved efficacy for lapatinib plus paclitaxel versu s placebo plus paclitaxel (ORR: odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.1 to 3.8; P = .365; P FS: hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.47; P = .797). ECD levels tended to de crease over time when bECD was elevated. ECD conversion from low to high was ass ociated with worse PFS. Converting from high to low was associated with a better PFS. A consistently low ECD level had better PFS than a consistently elevated E CD. All associations were found to be independent of lapatinib.

Preclinical findings of synergy between docetaxel, carboplati n, and trastuzumab (TCH) prompted a phase III randomized trial comparing TCH wit h TH in patients with HER2-amplified MBC.	Two hundred sixty-three patients were randomly assigned to receive eight 3-week cycles of TH (trastuzumab plus docetaxel 100 mg/m(2)) or TCH (trastuzumab plus c arboplatin at area under the serum concentration-time curve 6 and docetaxel 75 m g/m(2)). Trastuzumab was given at 4 mg/kg loading dose followed by a 2 mg/kg dos e once per week during chemotherapy, and then 6 mg/kg once every 3 weeks until p rogression.

There was no significant d ifference between TH and TCH in terms of the primary end point, time to progress ion (medians of 11.1 and 10.4 months, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.914; 95% CI, 0.694 to 1.203; P = .57), response rate (72% for both groups), or overall survi val (medians of 37.1 and 37.4 months, respectively; P = .99). Rates of grades 3 or 4 adverse effects for TH and TCH, respectively, were neutropenic-related comp lications, 29% and 23%; thrombocytopenia, 2% and 15%; anemia, 5% and 11%; sensor y neuropathy, 3% and 0.8%; fatigue, 5% and 12%; peripheral edema, 3.8% and 1.5%; and diarrhea, 2% and 10%. Two patients given TCH died of sepsis, and one patien t given TH experienced sudden cardiac death. Absolute left ventricular ejection fraction decline > 15% was seen in 5.5% of patients on the THarm and 6.7% of pa tients on the TCH arm.

Luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched (HER2-E), and basal-like subtypes were correlated with relapse-free survival (R FS) and overall survival (OS), estimated using Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank t esting. Multivariable Cox regression analyses determined significance of interac tion between treatment and intrinsic subtypes.	Intrinsic subtypes were associated with RFS (P = 0.0005) and OS (P < 0.0001) on the combined cohort. The HER2-E showed the greatest benefit fromCEF versus CMF, with absolute 5-year RFS and OS differences exceeding 20%, whereas there was a less than 2% difference for non-HER2-E tumors (interaction test P = 0.03 for RFS and 0.03 for OS). Within clinically defined Her2(+) tumors, 79% (72 of 91) were classified as the HER2-E subtype by gene expression and this subset was strongl y associated with better response to CEF versus CMF (62% vs. 22%, P = 0.0006). T here was no significant difference in benefit between CEF and CMF in basal-like tumors [n = 94; HR, 1.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.6-2.1 for RFS and HR, 1 .3; 95% CI, 0.7-2.5 for OS].

Testing criteria define HER2-positive status when (on observing within an area of tumor that amounts to evidence of protein overexpression (IHC) or gene a mplification (by ISH based on counting at least 20 cells within the area). If re sults are equivocal (revised criteria), reflex testing should be performed using an alternative assay (IHC or ISH). Repeat testing should be considered if resul ts seem discordant with other histopathologic findings. Laboratories should demo nstrate high concordance with a validated HER2 test on a sufficiently large and representative set of specimens. Testing must be performed in a laboratory accre dited by CAP or another accrediting entity. The Update Committee urges providers and health systems to cooperate to ensure the highest quality testing.

This exploratory analysis evaluates Her-2/neu as a prognostic factor in a large cohort of patients with advanced-sta ge ovarian cancer treated with platinum/paclitaxel as first-line chemotherapy wi thin a prospective randomized trial.	Her-2/neu expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 359 patients (46%) treated within the AGO-OVAR 3 trial (n = 783). Patients received either cisplati n/paclitaxel or carboplatin/paclitaxel according tothe study protocol. Immunohi stochemistry results were scored according to the Dako score.	Her-2/neu Dako scores of 0 or 1+ was found in 337 patients (94%) and a score of 2+ or 3+ in 22 patients (6%). Her-2/neu overexpression (2+/3+) was associated wi th a higher International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage and larg er postoperative residual disease. There were no significant differences in resp onse to chemotherapy between the Her-2/neu score subgroups and in progression-fr ee survival time. In a multivariate analysis, the Her-2/neu score had no signifi cant impact on overall survival time.

Its role in non-HER2-amplified MBC remains unclear. EGF30001, a phase III trial of lapatinib and paclitaxel versus paclitaxel and p lacebo, demonstrated lapatinib does not significantlybenefit HER2-negative or H ER2-unselected patients with MBC. Published data support interactions between st eroid hormone and peptide growth factor signaling. We hypothesized that molecula r subgroups may exist within EGF30001 that would benefit from lapatinib.	A blinded, retrospective biomarker evaluation was performed using immunohistoche mistry to semiquantitate estrogen (ER), progesterone(PR), and EGFR expression. HER2 amplification was determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Effects of these biomarkers on event-free survival (EFS) were examined in patients with available tissue (n = 493).	Lapatinib improved median EFS in HER2-amplified, ER- or PR-positive MBC (n = 36; 5.7 v 4.5 months; P = .351); benefit was greater and statistically significant in HER2-amplified, ER-negative, PR-negative MBC (n = 42; 8.3 v 5.0 months; P = . 007). In HER2-negative, ER-positive MBC, median EFS improvement varied by degree of PR expression (H-score): no benefit if PR-strong (n = 133; 9.3 v 7.3 months; P = .373), benefit if PR-weak (n = 50; 7.3 v 2.4 months; P = .026), and potenti al antagonism if PR-negative (n = 40; 3.7 v 7.2 months; P = .004). No benefit wa s seen in triple-negative MBC (n = 131; median EFS, 4.6 v 4.8 months; P = .255). EGFR expression was not correlated with benefit from lapatinib

Forty-three acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with a media n age of 64 years (range, 24-87 years) were enrolled; 37 were evaluable for resp onse. FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutati on was detected in 40 (93%) patients, with a median allelic ratio of 0.32 (range , 0.009-0.93). They had received a median of 2 prior treatment regimens (range, 0-7); 9 had failed prior therapy with a FLT3 kinase inhibitor.	The response rate was 46%, including 10 (27%) complete response with incomplete count recovery (CRi), 6 (16%) complete responses (CR), and 1 (3%) partial respon se. The median time to achieve CR/CRi was 2 cycles (range, 1-4), and the median duration of CR/CRi was 2.3 months (range, 1-14.3 months). Sixty-four percent of patients achieved adequate (defined as >85%) FLT3 inhibition during their first cycle of therapy. The degree of FLT3 inhibition correlated with plasma sorafenib concentrations. FLT3ligand levels did not rise to levels seen in prior studies of patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy.

The primary end point, fraction of progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months, was 31/42 [ 74%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 58% to 84%]. Forty-two patients had measurable disease. Response rate was 33% and disease control rate 86%. Median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI 6.7-8.7 months) and median overall survival was 10.0 months (95% CI 7.4-12.7 months). Toxicity was manageable including eight cases of epidermal growth factor receptor-related skin adverse events of grade 2 or more.

We analyzed serum obtained at enrollment (12(0/7) to 19(6/7) weeks) and follow-u p (24-28 weeks) from 704 patients with previous PE and/or chronic hypertension ( CHTN) enrolled in a randomized trial for the prevention of PE. Logistic regressi on analysis assessed the association of log-transformed markers with subsequent PE; receiver operating characteristic analysis assessed predictive value	One hundred four developed preeclampsia: 27 at 37 weeks or longer and 77 at less than 37 weeks (9 at less than 27 weeks). None of the markers was associated wit h PE at 37 weeks or longer. Significant associations were observed between PE at less than 37 weeks and reduced PLGF levels at baseline (P = .022) and follow-up (P < .0001) and elevated inhibin A (P < .0001) and sFlt-1 (P = .0002) levels at follow-up; at 75% specificity, sensitivities ranged from 38% to 52%. Using chan ges in markers from baseline to follow-up, sensitivities were 52-55%.

We examined the i nfluence of baseline plasma levels of IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-3, and C-peptide on o utcome among patients receiving first-line chemotherapy for metastatic colorecta l cancer.	The plasma levels of IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-3, and C-peptide as well as data on pr ognostic factors and body size were measured at baseline among 527 patients part icipating in a randomized trial of first-line chemotherapy for metastatic colore ctal cancer.	Higher baseline plasma IGFBP-3 levels were associated with a significantly great er chemotherapy response rate (P = 0.03) after adjusting for other prognostic fa ctors, whereas neither IGF-I nor IGF-II levels significantly predicted tumor res ponse. Higher levels of IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGFBP-3 were all univariately associa ted with improved overall survival (P = 0.0001 for all). In a model that mutuall y adjusted for IGF-I and IGFBP-3, as well as other prognostic factors, increasin g baseline-circulating IGFBP-3 was associated with a significantly longer time t o tumor progression (P = 0.03), whereas circulating IGF-I was not associated wit h disease progression (P = 0.95).

BM000046	Interleukin-8 (IL8)	Stress	ICD-11: 6B40-6B45 ; ICD-9: 308	Diagnostic	The 24 hS generated a prolonged response of the immune system. Urinary IL-8 was a strong biomarker of stress under intensive and prolonged demands, both acutely and over time. Because elevated IL-8 levels are associated with cardiovascular disease and negative psychological consequences, we suggest that emergency physi cians limit their exposure to 24 hS, especially with advancing age.	P10145	Urinary interleukin-8 is a biomarker of stress in emergency physicians, especially with advancing age--the JOBSTRESS* randomized trial. PLoS One. 2013 Aug 19;8(8):e71658.	urine		Protein	Elevated level			Clinical trial	To determine if Interleukin-8 (IL-8) can be used as a chronic stress biomarker	We conducted a shifts-randomized trial comparing 17 emergency physicians' urinar y IL-8 levels during a 24 hS, a 14 hS, and a control day (clerical work on retur n from leave). Mean levels of IL-8 were compared using a Wilcoxon matched-pairs test. Independent associations of key factors including shifts, stress, and age with IL-8 levels were further assessed in a multivariable generalized estimating equations model.	Mean urinary IL-8 levels almost doubled during and after a 24 hS compared with a 14 hS or a control day. Furthermore, IL-8 levels failed to return to control va lues at the end of the third day after the shift despite a rest day following th e 24 hS. In the multivariable model, engaging in a 24 hS, self-reported stress, and age were independently associated with higher IL-8 levels. A 24 hS significa ntly increased IL-8 levels by 1.9 ng (paS=aS.007). Similarly, for every unit i ncrease in self-reported stress, there was a 0.11 ng increase in IL-8 levels (pi ii=aS.003); and for every one year advance in age of physicians, IL-8 levels al so increased by 0.11 ng (paS=aS.018).

To stage patients with testicular non-seminomas, the Panel recom mended measuring three markers (AFP, hCG, and LDH) before and after orchiectomy, and before chemotherapy for those with extra-gonadal non-seminomas. They also r ecommended measuring AFP and hCG shortly before retroperitoneal lymph node disse ction and at the start of each chemotherapy cycle for non-seminoma, and periodic ally to monitor for relapse. The Panel recommended measuring post-orchiectomy hC G and LDH for patients with seminoma and pre-orchiectomy elevations. They recomm ended against using markers to guide or monitor treatment forseminoma or to det ect relapse in those treated for stage I. However, they recommended measuring hC G and AFP to monitor for relapse in patients treated for advanced seminoma.

Searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE identified relevant studies published in English. Primary outcomes included marker accuracy to predict impact of decisions on out comes. Secondary outcomes included proportions with elevated markers, and statis tical tests of elevations as prognostic factors. An expert panel developed conse nsus guidelines based on data from 81 reports.	No studies directly compared outcomes of decisions with versus without marker as says. The search identified few prospective studies and no RCTs; most were retro spective series. Lacking data on primary outcomes, most Panel recommendations ar e based on secondary outcomes (relapse rates and time to relapse).

Clinical Trial Registration- URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Uni que identifier: ISRCTN23620802.	P42898	Blood pressure in treated hypertensive individuals with the MTHFR 677TT genotype is responsive to intervention with riboflavin: findings of a targeted randomized trial. Hypertension. 2013 Jun;61(6):1302-8.		Response to treatment	Gene polymorphism	677CaT polymorphism	riboflavin		Clinical trial	The aim of this randomized trial, therefore, was to investigate the responsivene ss of BP to riboflavin supplementation in hypertensive individuals with the TT g enotype but without overt cardiovascular disease.	From an available sample of 1427 patients with hypertension, we identified 157 w ith the MTHFR 677TT genotype, 91 of whom agreed to participate in the trial. Par ticipants were stratified by systolic BP and randomized to receive placebo or ri boflavin (1.6 mg/d) for 16 weeks	At baseline, despite being prescribed multiple classes of antihypertensive drugs, >60% of participants with this genotype had failed to reach goal BP (a140/90 mm Hg). A significant improvement in the biomarker status of riboflavin was obs erved in response to intervention (P<0.001). Correspondingly, an overall treatme nt effect of 5.6A2.6 mm Hg (P=0.033) in systolic BP was observed, with pre- and postintervention values of 141.8A2.9 and 137.1A3.0 mm Hg (treatment group)an d 143.5A3.0 and 144.3A3.1 mm Hg (placebo group), whereas the treatment effect in diastolic BP was not significant (P=0.291)

Response to treatment	Gene mutation	Mutant NPM1 without FLT3 internal tandem duplications	all-trans retinoic acid		Phase III	The objectives of this study were to evaluate the prognostic impact of gene muta tions and to identify predictive genetic factors for the all-trans retinoic acid treatment effect.	Data from mutation analyses of the NPM1, CEBPA, FLT3, and MLL genes were correla ted with outcome in patients 61 years and older treated within the AML HD98B tri al.	The frequencies of mutations were: NPM1, 23%; CEBPA, 8.5% (analysis restricted t o patients with a normal karyotype); FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITD), 17 %; FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain mutations, 5%; and MLL partial tandem duplication s, 4.5%. The genotype mutant NPM1 was positively and adverse cytogenetics as wel l as higher white blood cell count negatively correlated with achievement of com plete remission. In Cox regression analysis, a significant interaction between t he genotype mutant NPM1 without FLT3-ITD and treatment with all-trans retinoic a cid was identified, in that the beneficial effect of all-trans retinoic acid on relapse-free and overall survival was restricted to this subgroup of patients. O ther significant factors for survival were age, adverse cytogenetics, and logari thm of white cell count.

Its role in non-HER2-amplified MBC remains unclear. EGF30001, a phase III trial of lapatinib and paclitaxel versus paclitaxel and p lacebo, demonstrated lapatinib does not significantlybenefit HER2-negative or H ER2-unselected patients with MBC. Published data support interactions between st eroid hormone and peptide growth factor signaling. We hypothesized that molecula r subgroups may exist within EGF30001 that would benefit from lapatinib.	A blinded, retrospective biomarker evaluation was performed using immunohistoche mistry to semiquantitate estrogen (ER), progesterone(PR), and EGFR expression. HER2 amplification was determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Effects of these biomarkers on event-free survival (EFS) were examined in patients with available tissue (n = 493).	Lapatinib improved median EFS in HER2-amplified, ER- or PR-positive MBC (n = 36; 5.7 v 4.5 months; P = .351); benefit was greater and statistically significant in HER2-amplified, ER-negative, PR-negative MBC (n = 42; 8.3 v 5.0 months; P = . 007). In HER2-negative, ER-positive MBC, median EFS improvement varied by degree of PR expression (H-score): no benefit if PR-strong (n = 133; 9.3 v 7.3 months; P = .373), benefit if PR-weak (n = 50; 7.3 v 2.4 months; P = .026), and potenti al antagonism if PR-negative (n = 40; 3.7 v 7.2 months; P = .004). No benefit wa s seen in triple-negative MBC (n = 131; median EFS, 4.6 v 4.8 months; P = .255). EGFR expression was not correlated with benefit from lapatinib

We assessed whether centrall y determined ER, progesterone receptor (PgR), human epidermal growth factor rece ptor 2, and Ki-67 labeling index, alone or incombination with other prognostic features, predicted the magnitude of letrozole effectiveness compared with eithe r sequence or tamoxifen monotherapy.	Individually, none of the markers significantly predicted differential treatment effects. Subpopulation treatment effect pattern plot analysis of a composite me asure of prognostic risk revealed three patterns. Estimated 5-year disease-free survival for letrozole monotherapy, letrozoleatamoxifen, tamoxifenaletrozole , and tamoxifen monotherapy were 96%, 94%, 93%, and 94%, respectively, for patie nts at lowest risk; 90%, 91%, 93%, and 86%, respectively, for patients at interm ediate risk; and 80%, 76%, 74%, and 69%, respectively, for patients at highest r isk.

However, the role of COX-2 overexpression in head and neck ca ncers remains undetermined. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether COX-2 is a prognostic factor in glottic cancer.	This study was part of a phase III placebo-controlled randomized trial evaluatin gthe efficacy of alpha-tocopherol in reducing second primary cancers (SPC) in h ead and neck cancer patients. Immunohistochemical analyses were conducted on pre treatment biopsies of 301 patients withearly-stage glottic cancer treated by ra diotherapy. The median value of 50% of positive tumor cells was the cutoff point used to define COX-2 overexpression. Outcomes considered in the statistical ana lysis were recurrence, SPC, and death. The Cox proportional hazards model was us ed to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI ).	The HR associated with COX-2overexpression was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.55-1.62) for rec urrence. The HR associated with SPC was 2.63 (95% CI, 1.32-5.23) for the first 3 .5 years of follow-up and 0.55 (95% CI, 0.22-1.32) for the following 3.5 years. The HR associated with COX-2 overexpression was 1.57 (95% CI, 1.01-2.45) for ove rall mortality.

Approximately 14% of men with a tPSA below 3 microg/l have prostate cancer o n biopsy, but the diagnostic value of %fPSA in such men is rather unknown. The p urpose was to estimate the impact of %fPSA on future prostate cancer risk among men with a normal tPSA in prostate cancer screening.	The first round of the Finnish arm of the European Randomized Trial for Screenin g of Prostate Cancer in 1996 to 1999 comprised 20,793 men aged 55-67 yr. Screen- negative men (tPSA level below 3.0 microg/l, n=17,680) were followed up until th e end of 2003. Cumulative risk of prostate cancer was calculated as a function o f %fPSA.	During the median follow-up of 5.8 yr (range, 0-7.7 yr), 327 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer and 25% of them had a Gleason score of 7 or higher. Five ye ars after the first screening, cumulative risk of prostate cancer was 1.7% (95%C I, 1.5-1.9%). Men with a %fPSA in the lowest quartile (<14.2%) showed a 6.9-fold risk compared with those with a level in the highest quartile (>23.7%).

Patients in this trial had T2b, T2c, T3, and T4 N0 prostate cancer and were rand omized to 0, 3, or 6 months of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (NADT)p rior to and during radiation treatment at 66 Gy to the prostate and seminal vesi cles. The early PSA test-based variables evaluated were the pretreatment initial PSA (iPSA) value, PSA values at 2 and 4 months into NADT, the PSA nadir (nPSA) value after radiation in all patients, and PSA response signatures in men receiv ing radiation. Comparisons of endpoints were made using Cox models of localprog ression-free survival, distant failure-free survival, biochemical failure-free s urvival, and prostate cancer-specific survival.	The nPSA value was a powerful predictor of all endpoints regardless of whether N ADT was given before radiation. PSA response signatures also predicted all endpo ints in men treated by radiation alone. iPSA and PSA results at 2 and 4 months i nto NADT predictedbiochemical failure-free survival but not any of the clinical endpoints. nPSA values correlated with those of iPSA, Gleason grade, and T stag e and were significantly higher in men receiving radiation alone than in those r eceiving NADT.

In the Rotterdam section of the ERSPC, a total of 42,376 participants, aged 55-7 4 years, identified from population registries were randomly assigned to a scree ning or control arm. a For the ERSPC men undergo PSA screening at 4-year inter vals. A total of three screening rounds were evaluated; therefore, only menaged 55-69 years at the first screening were eligible for the present study.	PPVs for men without previous biopsy remained equal throughout the three subsequ ent screenings (25.5, 22.3 and 24.8% respectively). a Conversely, PPVs for men with a previous negative biopsy dropped significantly (12.0 and 15.2% at the se cond and third screening, respectively). a Additionally, in men with and witho ut previous biopsy, the percentage of aggressive prostate cancers (clinical stag e >T2b, Gleason score aY 7) decreased after the first round of screening from 4 4.4 to 23.8% in the second (P < 0.001) and 18.6% in the third round (P < 0.001). a Repeat biopsies accounted for 24.6% of all biopsies, but yielded only 8.6% of all aggressive cancers.

A predictive b iomarker is greatly needed to select chemotherapy-sensitive patients for these m icrotubule-interfering agents. Class III I-tubulin (TUBB3) has been shown of va lue in NSCLC, but evidence is not uniform. Accordingly, we explored the predicti ve role of TUBB3 in advanced NSCLC.	Four hundred forty-three patients with advanced NSCLC were enrolled in a phase I II trial and randomized to vinorelbine- or paclitaxel-containing chemotherapy. I mmunohistochemical evaluation of TUBB3 status was mainly done on bioptic materia l and correlated to response rates, progression-free survival (PFS), overall sur vival (OS), quality of life (QOL), and toxicity.	Two hundred sixty-one (58.9%) patients had representative tissue samples for TUB B3 evaluation. Patients with TUBB3-negative adenocarcinomas had a significantly prolonged PFS and OS when compared with the opposite subgroup (7.87 vs. 6.83 mon ths, P = 0.035 and 14.17 vs. 11.17 months, P = 0.018, respectively). Multivariat e analyses revealed an HR of 1.55 (95% CI, 1.04-2.31, P = 0.032) for TUBB3-posit ive adenocarcinoma patients. TUBB3-negative adenocarcinoma patients showed a mea n QOL decline of -18.25 points (95% CI, -4.28 to -32.22, P = 0.013) as compared with -3.86 (95% CI, -7.0 to 15.52, P = 0.5).

The clinical activity of IFN- I is thought to be mediated not only by anti-proliferative effects, but also by induction and modulation of secondary cytokines. We examined serum cytokine lev els in IFN-I-treated patients to find potential biological markers for response or toxicity.	In a prospective randomized trial, 66 stages II and III melanoma patients underw ent an induction treatment of 10 MU IFN I2b s.c. 5 /week, followed by either 5 MU or 10 MU IFN I2b s.c. 3 /week for a total of 2 years. Serial measurement s of serum IL-1I, IL-2, sIL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-I and I-2 microglobulin (B2M ) were taken. Two factorial analysis of repeated measurements (ANOVA) as well as univariate and multivariate analyses was used to identify prognostic factors fo r relapse and toxicity.	TNF-I levels correlated with toxicity. In patients with relapse, significantly lower levels of TNF-I were detected at baseline and throughout therapy compared with patients without relapse. B2M and sIL-2R showed a significant increase thr oughout the therapy phase. At baseline, the combination of TNF-I, B2M and sIL-2 R revealed a positive predictive value for relapse of 82.9% in the multivariate analyses.
