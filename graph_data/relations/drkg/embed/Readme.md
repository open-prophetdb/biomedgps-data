# Pre-trained DRKG embedding
The DRKG mebedding is trained using TransE\_l2 model with dimention size of 400, there are four files:
 - DRKG\_TransE\_l2\_entity.npy, NumPy binary data, storing the entity embedding
 - entities.tsv, mapping from entity\_name to tentity\_id.
 - DRKG\_TransE\_l2\_relation.npy, NumPy binary data, storing the relation embedding
 - relations.tsv, mapping from relation\_name to relation\_id
