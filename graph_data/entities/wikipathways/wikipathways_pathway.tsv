WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP127	IL-5 signaling pathway		Interleukin 5 (IL-5) ligand belongs to the cytokine superfamily. IL-5 is a glycoprotein which belongs to the cytokine superfamily. It possesses the four helical bundle motifs that is conserved among several hematopoietic cytokines. IL-5 plays an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of eosinophils. IL-5 induces terminal maturation of eosinophils, prolongs eosinophils survival by delaying apoptotic death, increases eosinophils adhesion to endothelial cells and enhances eosinophils effector function. IL-5 plays important roles in the pathogenesis of asthma, hypereosinophilic syndromes and eosinophil-dependent inflammatory diseases. IL-5 is produced by eosinophils, mast cells, Th2 cells, Tc2 cells and gamma delta T cells. IL-5 exerts influence on different biological activities by associating with the IL-5 receptor. This receptor is a heterodimeric complex consisting of an alpha chain-IL5RA and a beta chain, CSF2RB, which is shared between IL-5 receptor, IL-3 receptor and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor. Binding of IL-5 to the receptor complex results in the recruitment of adapter proteins including SHC1, GRB2 and SOS1. This leads to the activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. Subsequent activation of transcription factors including JUN and ELK-1 regulates the expression of genes involved in the control of cell growth and differentiation. IL-5 stimulation also resulted in the activation of PI3K/AKT/RPS6K pathway resulting in the phosphorylation of RPS6 and regulation of gene expression. JAK phosphorylation and activation is also brought about by IL-5, which in turn results in the activation and nuclear translocation of STAT proteins. The STAT transcription factors are responsible for the expression of early response genes and feedback inhibitor of JAK/STAT pathway. In addition, IL-5 is known to activate various tyrosine kinases such as LYN, BTK and SYK. The interactions and intersections between canonical and non-canonical IL-5 signaling systems are depicted in the pathway map.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_5_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite the following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP138	Androgen receptor signaling pathway		Androgens, mainly testosterone and 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) play significant role in the growth and development of the male reproductive organs. These steroid hormones bring about their biological functions through their associations with Androgen receptor (AR), a 110 KDa ligand dependent transcription factor that falls under the group of nuclear receptor superfamily. DHT binds the receptor with high affinity compared to testosterone. The AR gene is located in the X chromosome at Xq11-12 site. AR is cytosolic protein, which in the ligand unbound state, is present as a complex with various Heat shock proteins primarily Hsp70, 90 and 56 as well as p23. Upon ligand binding, it dissociates from the complex. AR is found to be expressed in a number of tissues and cells including prostate, testis, seminal vesicle, epididymis, skin, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, liver and central nervous system. The protein has four functional domains- an N terminal domain (NTD), a DNA binding domain (DBD), a hinge region and a Ligand binding Domain (LBD). The DBD is a 658 amino acid residue region that has ZNF motifs which allows it bind to DNA. The rest of the domains are involved in dimerization and ligand binding. Two phosphorylation events are proposed to play very important role in the activation of the receptor upon ligand binding. The first phosphorylation event releases the ligand binding domain for hormone binding. The subsequent phosphorylation event is triggered upon hormone binding. Activated AR upon ligand binding undergoes conformational change to form a homodimer and interacts tightly with the Androgen Response Element (ARE). The androgen receptor is known to bind to many co-regulators at different time points and in different cell types. This DNA protein complex triggers the expression of various target genes that are associated with the male phenotype. Modulation of the AR activity is carried out by several transcription factors like ARA70, TR4, SRC family members and CBP/p300 and other associated proteins. FXXLF and WXXLF motifs containing coactivators such as the p160 members bind with the AF2 region of the Ligand Binding Domain of the AR. Androgen receptors are known to induce apoptosis under certain conditions. Various regulators that regulate androgen induced apoptosis include BRCA1 and Smad3 and Akt. Mutation in AR are also known to be associated in a number of diseases including spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) or Kennedy's disease and Androgen Insensitivity syndrome (AIS). Abnormal amplification of the androgen gene as well as deregulation of AR gene expression have been shown to be associated with prostate cancer.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/ar_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1403	AMP-activated protein kinase signaling		AMPK signaling pathway, a fuel sensor and regulator, promotes ATP-producing and inhibits ATP-consuming pathways in various tissues. AMPK is a heterotrimer composed of alpha-catalytic and beta and gamma-regulatory subunits. Humans and rodents have two alpha and beta and three gamma isoforms; some genes are subject to alternative splicing increasing the range of possible heterotrimer combinations. Cellular stresses that inhibit ATP production or increase its consumption change the AMP:ATP ratio and activate the pathway. AMPK activation by AMP is not completely understood; the current model states that binding of AMP to the gamma subunit leads to conformational changes that allosterically activate AMPK and render phosphorylated-Thr172 unavailable for inhibitory dephosphorylation. ATP antagonizes the effect of AMP; both AMP and ATP bind in a mutually exclusive manner to the Bateman (CBS) domains of the gamma subunit. The upstream kinase, known as Lkb1, is a complex of one catalytic and two regulatory subunits; Lkb1 is believed to be 'constitutively active'. In certain cell types, Thr172 can be phosphorylated by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinases (CAmKK), in turn activated by calcium. A well known role of AMPK is in the regulation of lipid metabolism; it stimulates fatty acids oxidation and inhibits their synthesis. Phosphorylation by AMPK inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and results in reduced levels of malonyl-CoA product. Malonyl CoA is a substrate in the de novo synthesis of fatty acids and fatty acids elongation. Importantly, it is also an inhibitor of the carnitine palmitoyl transferase I, required for the transfer of primed cytosolic fatty acids into the mitochondrion where they can undergo degradative beta-oxidation. AMPK inhibits mTOR signaling pathway by activating Tsc2 and downstream of Tsc2 by inhibiting Raptor component of mTOR complex 1 [note that this effect is opposite to Tsc2 phosphorylation and inactivation by PI3K-Akt signaling downstream of insulin]. AMPK is also involved in promoting glucose uptake and utilization and integrates adipokynes and hormonal signals in both the hypothalamus and the periphery with potential impact on energy expenditure and uptake by molecular mechanisms that remain to be established. Due to its roles in fuel regulation, the AMPK pathway is regarded as a potential therapeutic target for diabetes type II, obesity and metabolic syndrome. As a note, drugs used in the treatment of insulin resistance and diabetes can activate AMPK.AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a key role as a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. The kinase is activated in response to stresses that deplete cellular ATP supplies such as low glucose, hypoxia, ischemia and heat shock. It exists as a heterotrimeric complex composed of a catalytic α subunit and regulatory β and γ subunits. Binding of AMP to the γ subunit allosterically activates the complex, making it a more attractive substrate for its major upstream AMPK kinase, LKB1. Several studies indicate that signaling through adiponectin, leptin and CAMKKβ may also be important in activating AMPK.As a cellular energy sensor responding to low ATP levels, AMPK activation positively regulates signaling pathways that replenish cellular ATP supplies. For example, activation of AMPK enhances both the transcription and translocation of GLUT4, resulting in an increase in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In addition, it also stimulates catabolic processes such as fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis via inhibition of ACC and activation of PFK2. AMPK negatively regulates several proteins central to ATP consuming processes such as TORC2, glycogen synthase, SREBP-1 and TSC2, resulting in the downregulation or inhibition of gluconeogenesis, glycogen, lipid and protein synthesis. Due to its role as a central regulator of both lipid and glucose metabolism, AMPK is considered to be a key therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity, type II diabetes mellitus, and cancer.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1403 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1531	Vitamin D metabolism		Photochemical synthesis of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, D3) occurs cutaneously where pro-vitamin D3 (7-dehydrocholesterol) is converted to pre-vitamin D3 (pre-D3) in response to ultraviolet B (sunlight) exposure. DHCR7 encodes the enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) reductase, which converts 7-DHC to cholesterol, thereby removing the substrate from the synthetic pathway of vitamin D3, a precursor of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3.The finding that common variants at DHCR7 are strongly associated with circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations suggests that this enzyme could have a larger role in regulation of vitamin D status than has previously been recognised. Vitamin D3, obtained from the isomerization of pre-vitamin D3 in the epidermal basal layers or intestinal absorption of natural and fortified foods and supplements, binds to vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) in the bloodstream, and is transported to the liver. D3 is hydroxylated by liver 25-hydroxylases (25-OHase). The resultant 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D3) is 1-hydroxylated in the kidney by 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1 -hydroxylase (1-OHase). This yields the active secosteroid 1 ,25(OH)2D3 (calcitriol), which has different effects on various target tissues. The synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D3 from 25(OH)D3 is stimulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and suppressed by Ca2+, Pi and 1,25(OH)2D3 itself. The rate-limiting step in catabolism is the degradation of 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 to 24,25(OH)D3 and 1,24,25(OH)2D3, respectively,which occurs through 24-hydroxylation by 25-hydroxyvitamin D 24-hydroxylase (24-OHase), encoded by the CYP24A1 gene. 24,25(OH)D3 and 1,24,25(OH)2D3 are consequently excreted. Vitamin D activity is mediated through binding of 1,25(OH)2D3 to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which can regulate transcription of other genes involved in cell regulation, growth, and immunity. VDR modulates the expression of genes by forming a heterodimer complex with retinoid-X-receptors (RXR).Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1531 CPTAC Assay Portal].		9606

""Diabetogenic"" factors including FFA, TNFalpha and cellular stress induce insulin resistance through inhibition of IRS1 functions. Serine/threonine phosphorylation, interaction with SOCS, regulation of the expression, modification of the cellular localization, and degradation represent the molecular mechanisms stimulated by them. Various kinases (ERK, JNK, IKKbeta, PKCzeta, PKCtheta and mTOR) are involved in this process.The development of type II diabetes requires impaired beta-cell function. Chronic hyperglycemia has been shown to induce multiple defects in beta-cells. Hyperglycemia has been proposed to lead to large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in beta-cells, with subsequent damage to cellular components including PDX-1. Loss of PDX-1, a critical regulator of insulin promoter activity, has also been proposed as an important mechanism leading to beta-cell dysfunction. Although there is little doubt as to the importance of genetic factors in type II diabetes, genetic analysis is difficult due to complex interaction among multiple susceptibility genes and between genetic and environmental factors. Genetic studies have therefore given very diverse results. Kir6.2 and IRS are two of the candidate genes. It is known that Kir6.2 and IRS play central roles in insulin secretion and insulin signal transmission, respectively.Source: [http://www.kegg.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+map04930 KEGG]Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1584 CPTAC Assay Portal]."		9606

Nicotine is the main factor behind smoking addiction, therefore nicotine supplements can be used to stop smoking. Nicotine is metabolized by several enzymes in the liver such as the CYP2A6 enzyme.CYP2A6 is a xenobiotic (xenos = foreigner, bios = life) metabolizer. How well nicotine can be metabolized by the human body is not standard and depends on racial, gender, genetic and environmental factors.  The cotinine metabolite seen above in the center of the nicotine metabolism pathway is a smoking biomarker and can been measured in various tissues such as blood, urine and sweat.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1602	Nicotine effect on dopaminergic neurons		Nicotine is an alkaloid found in tobacco plants. It is a substance that acts as a stimulant in humans and is one of the main factors responsible for tobacco dependence. When nicotine enters the body, it is distributed quickly through the bloodstream, and it can cross the blood-brain barrier to enter the central nervous system (CNS). It binds to two main types of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: the ganglion type and the CNS type.In dopaminergic neurons in the CNS, nicotine binds to the CNS-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The main type of CNS receptor is composed of alpha 4 beta 2 (CHRNA4, CHRNB2) subunits. It has been shown that alpha 6, alpha 5, and beta 3 can also be in the receptor complex to modulate binding sensitivity. By binding to the receptor, nicotine causes cell depolarization and release of dopamine from the cell through the SNARE complex. Dopamine then binds to dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) on dopaminergic terminals and activates Gi alpha (GNAI1), initiating a feedback loop to inhibit dopamine release. One of the key players mediating dopamine signaling is PPP1R1B (also called DARPP-32, dopamine and cyclic AMP-regulated phospho-protein). PPP1R1B is a bifunctional signal transduction molecule which, by distinct mechanisms, inhibits either a serine/threonine kinase (PPKACA or PKA) or a serine/threonine phosphatase (PPP1CA or protein phosphatase 1). When PPP1R1B is phosphorylated by PPKACA at threonine 34, it is an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PPP1CA), which inhibits dopamine secretion through the SNARE complex. When PPP1R1B is phosphorylated by CDK5 at threonine 75, it is converted to an inhibitor of PPKACA. Binding of dopamine to D2-like dopamine receptors leads to inhibition of adenylate cyclase (ADCY2) via G-protein GNAI1, and decreases PKA-stimulated phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr34. This, in turn, relieves the inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 (PPP1CA), and inhibits further dopamine release.Sources: [https://www.pharmgkb.org/pathway/PA162355621 Nicotine Pathway in Dopaminergic Neurons (PharmGKB)], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine Nicotine (Wikipedia)].Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1602 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606

It is a substance that acts as a stimulant in humans and is one of the main factors responsible for tobacco dependence. When nicotine enters the body, it is distributed quickly through the bloodstream, and it can cross the blood-brain barrier to enter the central nervous system (CNS). It binds to two main types of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: the ganglion type and the CNS type.In chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla, nicotine binds to the ganglion-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which is composed of alpha 3 (CHRNA3) and beta 4 (CHRNB4) subunits. By binding to the receptors, nicotine causes cell depolarization and an influx of calcium through voltage dependent calcium channels. Calcium triggers the release of epinephrine from the chromaffin vesicles into the bloodstream, which leads to increased heart rate and blood pressure and elevation of blood glucose level.Sources: [http://www.pharmgkb.org/do/serve?objId=PA162355620&objCls=Pathway PharmGKB:Nicotine in Chromaffin Cells], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine Wikipedia:Nicotine]		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1604	Codeine and morphine metabolism		The principal pathways for the metabolism of codeine occur in the liver, although some metabolism occurs in the intestine and brain. Approximately 50-70% of codeine is converted to codeine-6-glucuronide by UGT2B7. Codeine-6-glucuronide has a similar affinity to codeine for the mu-opioid receptor, coded for by the OPRM1 gene. Approximately 10-15% of codeine is N-demethylated to norcodeine by CYP3A4. Norcodeine also has a similar affinity to codeine for the mu-opioid receptor. Between 0-15% of codeine is O-demethylated to morphine, the most active metabolite, which has a 200 fold greater affinity for the mu-opioid receptor compared to codeine. This metabolic reaction is performed by CYP2D6.Approximately 60% of morphine is glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) while 5-10% is glucuronidated to morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G). These reactions are principally catalyzed by UGT2B7 in the liver. UGT1A1 may have a minor role in the formation of M3G, and UGT1A1 and UGT1A8 are capable of catalyzing the formation of M6G in vitro and so contribute to this pathway, although UGT1A8 is minimally expressed in the liver and so is not depicted here. M6G has a higher affinity for OPRM1 than morphine and M3G and so the ratio of morphine to M6G is considered an important indicator of analgesic effect.Transporters are also depicted in this pathway, as they influence the clearance of codeine, morphine, and their metabolites. Some of the evidence for the involvement of these transporters was derived from experiments done in mice and may or may not be translatable to human pharmacokinetics. The transporters present at the blood-brain barrier, not depicted in this pathway, as well as metabolic enzymes and transporters in the brain and GI tract, likely also play an important role in the pharmacokinetics of codeine and morphine.A disease linked to this pathway is Gilbert syndrome (visualised in pink), which is characterized by impaired glucuronidation due to a polymorphism in the gene encoding UGT1A1.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP170	Nuclear receptors		Nuclear receptors are a class of proteins found within the interior of cells that are responsible for sensing the presence of steroid and thyroid hormones and certain other molecules. In response, these receptors work in concert with other proteins to regulate the expression of specific genes thereby controlling the development, homeostasis, and metabolism of the organism. Nuclear receptors have the ability to directly bind to DNA and regulate the expression of adjacent genes, hence these receptors are classified as transcription factors. The regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptors only happens when a liganda molecule which affects the receptor's behavioris present. More specifically, ligand binding to a nuclear receptor results in a conformational change in the receptor which in turn activates the receptor resulting in up-regulation of gene expression. A unique property of nuclear receptors which differentiate them from other classes of receptors is their ability to directly interact with and control the expression of genomic DNA. Consequently nuclear receptors play key roles in both embryonic development and adult homeostasis.Source: Wikipedia ([[wikipedia:Nuclear_receptor]])Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP170 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1775	Cell cycle checkpoints		A hallmark of the human cell cycle in normal somatic cells is its precision. This remarkable fidelity is achieved by a number of signal transduction pathways, known as checkpoints, which monitor cell cycle progression ensuring an interdependency of S-phase and mitosis, the integrity of the genome and the fidelity of chromosome segregation.<p>Checkpoints are layers of control that act to delay CDK activation when defects in the division program occur. As the CDKs functioning at different points in the cell cycle are regulated by different means, the various checkpoints differ in the biochemical mechanisms by which they elicit their effect. However, all checkpoints share a common hierarchy of a sensor, signal transducers, and effectors that interact with the CDKs.<p>The stability of the genome in somatic cells contrasts to the almost universal genomic instability of tumor cells. There are a number of documented genetic lesions in checkpoint genes, or in cell cycle genes themselves, which result either directly in cancer or in a predisposition to certain cancer types. Indeed, restraint over cell cycle progression and failure to monitor genome integrity are likely prerequisites for the molecular evolution required for the development of a tumor. Perhaps most notable amongst these is the p53 tumor suppressor gene, which is mutated in >50% of human tumors.  Thus, the importance of the checkpoint pathways to human biology is clear.

These substrates include amino acids, lipids, inorganic ions, peptides, saccharides, peptides for antigen presentation, metals, drugs, and proteins. The ABC transporters not only move a variety of substrates into and out of the cell, but are also involved in intracellular compartmental transport. Energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP is used to transport the substrate across the membrane against a concentration gradient.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1781	Advanced glycosylation endproduct receptor signaling		Advanced Glycosylation End- product-specific Receptor (AGER) also known as Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE) is a multi-ligand membrane receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. It is considered to be a Pattern Recognition Receptor (Liliensiek et al. 2004). It recognizes a large variety of modified proteins known as advanced glycation/glycosylation endproducts (AGEs), a heterogenous group of structures that are generated by the Maillard reaction, a consequence of long-term incubation of proteins with glucose (Ikeda et al. 1996). Their accumulation is associated with diabetes, atherosclerosis, renal failure and ageing (Schmidt et al. 1999). The most prevalent class of AGE in vivo are N(6)-carboxymethyllysine (NECML) adducts (Kislinger et al. 1991). In addition to AGEs, AGER is a signal transduction receptor for amyloid-beta peptide (Ab) (Yan et al. 1996), mediating Ab neurotoxicity and promoting Ab influx into the brain. AGER also responds to the proinflammatory S100/calgranulins (Hofmann et al. 1999) and High mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1/Amphoterin/DEF), a protein linked to neurite outgrowth and cellular motility (Hori et al. 1995).<br><br>The major inflammatory pathway stimulated by AGER activation is NFkappaB. Though the signaling cascade is unclear, several pieces of experimental data suggest that activation of AGER leads to sustained activation and upregulation of NFkappaB, measured as NFkappaB translocation to the nucleus, and increased levels of de novo synthesized NFkappaB (Bierhaus et al. 2001). As this is clearly an indirect effect it is represented here as positive regulation of NFkappaB translocation to the nucleus. AGER can bind ERK1/2 and thereby activate the MAPK and JNK cascades (Bierhaus et al. 2005). View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=879415 Reactome].		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1785	Asparagine N-linked glycosylation		N-linked glycosylation is the most important form of post-translational modification for proteins synthesized and folded in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (Stanley et al. 2009). An early study in 1999 revealed that about 50% of the proteins in the Swiss-Prot database at the time were N-glycosylated (Apweiler et al. 1999). It is now established that the majority of the proteins in the secretory pathway require glycosylation in order to achieve proper folding.<br>The addition of an N-glycan to a protein can have several roles (Shental-Bechor & Levy 2009). First, glycans enhance the solubility and stability of the proteins in the ER, the golgi and on the outside of the cell membrane, where the composition of the medium is strongly hydrophilic and where proteins, that are mostly hydrophobic, have difficulty folding properly. Second, N-glycans are used as signal molecules during the folding and transport process of the protein: they have the role of labels to determine when a protein must interact with a chaperon, be transported to the golgi, or targeted for degradation in case of major folding defects. Third, and most importantly, N-glycans on completely folded proteins are involved in a wide range of processes: they help determine the specificity of membrane receptors in innate immunity or in cell-to-cell interactions, they can change the properties of hormones and secreted proteins, or of the proteins in the vesicular system inside the cell.<br>All N-linked glycans are derived from a common 14-sugar oligosaccharide synthesized in the ER, which is attached co-translationally to a protein while this is being translated inside the reticulum. The process of the synthesis of this glycan, known as Synthesis of the N-glycan precursor or LLO, constitutes one of the most conserved pathways in eukaryotes, and has been also observed in some eubacteria. The attachment usually happens on an asparagine residue within the consensus sequence asparagine-X-threonine by an complex called oligosaccharyl transferase (OST).<br>After being attached to an unfolded protein, the glycan is used as a label molecule in the folding process (also known as Calnexin/Calreticulin cycle) (Lederkremer 2009). The majority of the glycoproteins in the ER require at least one glycosylated residue in order to achieve proper folding, even if it has been shown that a smaller portion of the proteins in the ER can be folded without this modification.<br>Once the glycoprotein has achieved proper folding, it is transported via the cis-Golgi through all the Golgi compartments, where the glycan is further modified according to the properties of the glycoprotein. This process involves relatively few enzymes but due to its combinatorial nature, can lead to several millions of different possible modifications. The exact topography of this network of reactions has not been established yet, representing one of the major challenges after the sequencing of the human genome (Hossler et al. 2006).<br>Since N-glycosylation is involved in an great number of different processes, from cell-cell interaction to folding control, mutations in one of the genes involved in glycan assembly and/or modification can lead to severe development problems (often affecting the central nervous system). All the diseases in genes involved in glycosylation are collectively known as Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) (Sparks et al. 2003), and classified as CDG type I for the genes in the LLO synthesis pathway, and CDG type II for the others.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1788	Bile acid and bile salt metabolism		In a healthy adult human, about 500 mg of cholesterol is converted to bile salts daily. Newly synthesized bile salts are secreted into the bile and released into the small intestine where they emulsify dietary fats (Russell 2003). About 95% of the bile salts in the intestine are recovered and returned to the liver (Kullak-Ublick et al. 2004; Trauner and Boyer 2002). The major pathway for bile salt synthesis in the liver begins with the conversion of cholesterol to 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol. Bile salt synthesis can also begin with the synthesis of an oxysterol - 24-hydroxycholesterol or 27-hydroxycholesterol. In the body, the initial steps of these two pathways occur in extrahepatic tissues, generating intermediates that are transported to the liver and converted to bile salts via the 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol pathway. These extrahepatic pathways contribute little to the total synthesis of bile salts, but are thought to play important roles in extrahepatic cholesterol homeostasis (Javitt 2002).

The powerful adhesive interactions that are required for leukocytes to withstand local flow at the vessel wall is a multistep process mediated by different adhesion molecules. Platelets adhered to injured vessel walls form strong adhesive substrates for leukocytes. For instance, the initial tethering and rolling of leukocytes over the site of injury are mediated by reversible binding of selectins to their cognate cell-surface glycoconjugates.<p>Endothelial cells are tightly connected through various proteins, which regulate the organization of the junctional complex and bind to cytoskeletal proteins or cytoplasmic interaction partners that allow the transfer of intracellular signals.

Enzymes whose regulation plays a major role in determining the rate of cholesterol synthesis in the body are highlighted in red, and connections to other metabolic processes are indicated. The transformation of zymosterol into cholesterol can follow either of routes, one in which reduction of the double bond in the isooctyl side chain is the final step (cholesterol synthesis via desmosterol, also known as the Bloch pathway) and one in which this reduction is the first step (cholesterol biosynthesis via lathosterol, also known as the Kandutsch-Russell pathway). The former pathway is prominent in the liver and many other tissues while the latter is prominent in skin, where it may serve as the source of the 7-dehydrocholesterol that is the starting point for the synthesis of D vitamins. Defects in several of the enzymes involved in this process are associated with human disease and have provided useful insights into the regulatory roles of cholesterol and its synthetic intermediates in human development (Gaylor 2002; Herman 2003; Kandutsch & Russell 1960; Mitsche et al. 2015; Song et al. 2005).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1797	Circadian Clock		At the center of the mammalian circadian clock is a negative transcription/translation-based feedback loop: The BMAL1:CLOCK/NPAS2 (ARNTL:CLOCK/NPAS2) heterodimer transactivates CRY and PER genes by binding E-box elements in their promoters; the CRY and PER proteins then inhibit transactivation by BMAL1:CLOCK/NPAS2. BMAL1:CLOCK/NPAS2 activates transcription of CRY, PER, and several other genes in the morning. Levels of PER and CRY proteins rise during the day and inhibit expression of CRY, PER, and other BMAL1:CLOCK/NPAS2-activated genes in the afternoon and evening. During the night CRY and PER proteins are targeted for degradation by phosphorylation and polyubiquitination, allowing the cycle to commence again in the morning. <br>Transcription of the BMAL1 (ARNTL) gene is controlled by ROR-alpha and REV-ERBA (NR1D1), both of which are targets of BMAL1:CLOCK/NPAS2 in mice and both of which compete for the same element (RORE) in the BMAL1 promoter. ROR-alpha (RORA) activates transcription of BMAL1; REV-ERBA represses transcription of BMAL1. This mutual control forms a secondary, reinforcing loop of the circadian clock. REV-ERBA shows strong circadian rhythmicity and confers circadian expression on BMAL1. <br>BMAL1 can form heterodimers with either CLOCK or NPAS2, which act redundantly but show different tissue specificity. The BMAL1:CLOCK and BMAL1:NPAS2 heterodimers activate a set of genes that possess E-box elements (consensus CACGTG) in their promoters. This confers circadian expression on the genes. The PER genes (PER1, PER2, PER3) and CRY genes (CRY1, CRY2) are among those activated by BMAL1:CLOCK and BMAL1:NPAS2. PER and CRY mRNA accumulates during the morning and the proteins accumulate during the afternoon. PER and CRY proteins form complexes in the cytosol and these are bound by either CSNK1D or CSNK1E kinases which phosphorylate PER and CRY. The phosphorylated PER:CRY:kinase complex is translocated into the nucleus due to the nuclear localization signal of PER and CRY. Within the nucleus the PER:CRY complexes bind BMAL1:CLOCK and BMAL1:NPAS2, inhibiting their transactivation activity and their phosphorylation. This reduces expression of the target genes of BMAL1:CLOCK and BMAL1:NPAS2 during the afternoon and evening. <br>PER:CRY complexes also traffic out of the nucleus into the cytosol due to the nuclear export signal of PER. During the night PER:CRY complexes are polyubiquitinated and degraded, allowing the cycle to begin again. Phosphorylated PER is bound by Beta-TrCP1, a cytosolic F-box type component of some SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases. CRY is bound by FBXL3, a nucleoplasmic F-box type component of some SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases. Phosphorylation of CRY1 by Adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK) enhances degradation of CRY1. PER and CRY are subsequently polyubiquitinated and proteolyzed by the 26S proteasome.<br>The circadian clock is cell-autonomous and some, but not all cells of the body exhibit circadian rhythms in metabolism, cell division, and gene transcription. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus is the major clock in the body and receives its major input from light (via retinal neurons) and a minor input from nutrient intake.  The SCN and other brain tissues determine waking and feeding cycles and influence the clocks in other tissues by hormone secretion and nervous stimulation. Independently of the SCN, other tissues such as liver receive inputs from signals from the brain and from nutrients.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1798	Complement cascade		In the complement cascade, a panel of soluble molecules rapidly and effectively senses a danger or damage and triggers reactions to provide a response that discriminates among foreign intruders, cellular debris, healthy and altered host cells (Ricklin D et al. 2010). Complement proteins circulate in the blood stream in functionally inactive states. When triggered the complement cascade generates enzymatically active molecules (such as C3/C5 convertases) and biological effectors: opsonins (C3b, C3d and C4b), anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a), and C5b, which initiates assembly of the lytic membrane attack complex (MAC). Three branches lead to complement activation: the classical, lectin and alternative pathways (Kang YH et al. 2009; Ricklin D et al. 2010). The classical pathway is initiated by C1 complex binding to immune complexes, pentraxins or other targets such as apoptotic cells leading to cleavage of C4 and C2 components and formation of the classical C3 convertase, C4bC2a. The lectin pathway is activated by binding of mannan-binding lectin (MBL) to repetitive carbohydrate residues, or by binding of ficolins to carbohydrate or acetylated groups on target surfaces. MBL and ficolins interact with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP) leading to cleavage of C4 and C2 and formation of the classical C3 convertase, C4bC2a. The alternative pathway is spontaneously activated by the hydrolysis of the internal thioester group of C3 to give C3(H2O). Alternative pathway activation involves interaction of C3(H2O) and/or previously generated C3b with factor B, which is cleaved by factor D to generate the alternative C3 convertases C3(H2O)Bb and/or C3bBb. All three pathways merge at the proteolytic cleavage of component C3 by C3 convertases to form opsonin C3b and anaphylatoxin C3a. C3b covalently binds to glycoproteins scattered across the target cell surface. This is followed by an amplification reaction that generates additional C3 convertases and deposits more C3b at the local site. C3b can also bind to C3 convertases switching them to C5 convertases, which mediate C5 cleavage leading to MAC formation. Thus, the activation of the complement system leads to several important outcomes:  opsonization of target cells to enhance phagocytosis, lysis of target cells via membrane attack complex (MAC) assembly on the cell surface, production of anaphylatoxins C3a/C5a involved in the host inflammatory response, C5a-mediated leukocyte chemotaxis, and clearance of antibody-antigen complexes. The complement system is able to distinguish between pathological and physiological challenges, i.e. the outcomes of complement activation are predetermined by the trigger and are tightly tuned by a combination of initiation events with several regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory mechanisms use soluble (e.g., C4BP, CFI and CFH) and membrane-bound regulators (e.g., CR1, CD46(MCP), CD55(DAF) and CD59) and are coordinated by complement receptors such as CR1, CR2, etc. In response to microbial infection complement activation results in flagging microorganisms with opsonins for facilitated phagocytosis, formation of MAC on cells such as Gram-negative bacteria leading to cell lysis, and release of C3a and C5a to stimulate downstream immune responses and to attract leukocytes. Most pathogens can be eliminated by these complement-mediated host responses, though some pathogenic microorganisms have developed ways of avoiding complement recognition or blocking host complement attack resulting in greater virulence (Lambris JD et al. 2008; Serruto D et al. 2010). All three complement pathways (classical, lectin and alternative) have been implicated in clearance of dying cells (Mevorach D et al. 1998; Ogden CA et al. 2001; Gullstrand B et al.2009; Kemper C et al. 2008). Altered surfaces of apoptotic cells are recognized by complement proteins leading to opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis. In contrast to pathogens, apoptotic cells are believed to induce only a limited complement activation by allowing opsonization of altered surfaces but restricting the terminal pathway of MAC formation (Gershov D et al. 2000; Braunschweig A and Jozsi M 2011). Thus, opsonization facilitates clearance of dying cells and cell debris without triggering danger signals and further inflammatory responses (Fraser DA et al. 2007, 2009; Benoit ME et al. 2012). C1q-mediated complement activation by apoptotic cells has been shown in a variety of human cells: keratinocytes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), Jurkat T lymphoblastoid cells, lung adenocarcinoma cells (Korb LC and Ahearn JM 1997; Mold C and Morris CA 2001; Navratil JS et al. 2001; Nauta AJ et al. 2004). In addition to C1q the opsonization of apoptotic Jurkat T cells with MBL also facilitated clearance of these cells by both dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages (Nauta AJ et al. 2004). Also C3b, iC3b and C4b deposition on apoptotic cells as a consequence of activation of the complement cascade may promote complement-mediated phagocytosis. C1q, MBL and cleavage fragments of C3/C4 can bind to several receptors expressed on macrophages (e.g. cC1qR (calreticulin), CR1, CR3, CR4) suggesting a potential clearance mechanism through this interaction (Mevorach D et al. 1998; Ogden CA et al. 2001). Apoptosis is also associated with an altered expression of complement regulators on the surface of apoptotic cells. CD46 (MCP) bound to the plasma membrane of a healthy cell protects it from complement-mediated attack by preventing deposition of C3b and C4b, and reduced expression of CD46 on dying cells may lead to enhanced opsonization (Elward K et al. 2005). Upregulation of CD55 (DAF) and CD59 on apoptotic cell surfaces may protect damaged cells against complement mediated lysis (Pedersen ED et al. 2007; Iborra A et al. 2003; Hensel F et al. 2001). In addition, fluid-phase complement regulators such as C4BP, CFH may also inhibit lysis of apoptotic cells by limiting complement activation (Trouw LA et al 2007; Braunschweig A and Jozsi M. 2011). Complement facilitates the clearance of immune complexes (IC) from the circulation (Chevalier J and Kazatchkine MD 1989; Nielsen CH et al. 1997). Erythrocytes bear clusters of complement receptor 1 (CR1 or CD35), which serves as an immune adherence receptor for C3 and/or C4 fragments deposited on IC that are shuttled to liver and spleen, where IC are transferred and processed by tissue macrophages through an Fc receptor-mediated process. Complement proteins are always present in the blood and a small percentage spontaneously activate. Inappropriate activation leads to host cell damage, so on healthy human cells any complement activation or amplification is strictly regulated by surface-bound regulators that accelerate decay of the convertases (CR1, CD55), act as a cofactor for the factor I (CFI)-mediated degradation of C3b and C4b (CR1, CD46), or prevent the formation of MAC (CD59). Soluble regulators such as C4BP, CFH and FHL1 recognize self surface pattern-like glycosaminoglycans and further impair activation. Complement components interact with other biological systems. Upon microbial infection complement acts in cooperation with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to amplify innate host defense. Anaphylatoxin C5a binds C5a receptor (C5aR) resulting in a synergistic enhancement of the TLR and C5aR-mediated proinflammatory cytokine response to infection. This interplay is negatively modulated by co-ligation of TLR and the second C5a receptor, C5L2, suggesting the existence of complex immunomodulatory interactions (Kohl J 2006; Hajishengallis G and Lambris JD 2010). In addition to C5aR and C5L2, complement receptor 3 (CR3) facilitates TLR2 or TLR4 signaling pathways by promoting a recruitment of their sorting adaptor TIRAP (MAL) to the receptor complex (van Bruggen R et al. 2007; Kagan JC and Medzhitov R 2006). Complement may activate platelets or facilitate biochemical and morphological changes in the endothelium potentiating coagulation and contributing to homeostasis in response to injury (Oikonomopoulou K et al. 2012). The interplay of complement and coagulation also involves cleavage of C3 and C5 convertases by coagulation proteases, generating biologically active anaphylatoxins (Amara U et al. 2010). Complement is believed to link the innate response to both humoral and cell-mediated immunity (Toapanta FR and Ross TM 2006; Mongini PK et al. 1997). The majority of published data is based on experiments using mouse as a model organism. Further characterization of the influence of complement on B or T cell activation is required for the human system, since differences between murine models and the human system are not yet fully determined. Complement is also involved in regulation of mobilization and homing of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from bone marrow to the circulation and peripheral tissue in order to accommodate blood cell replenishment (Reca R et al. 2006). Thus, the complement system orchestrates the host defense by sensing a danger signal and transmitting it into specific cellular responses while extensively communicating with associated biological pathways ranging from immunity and inflammation to homeostasis and development. Originally the larger fragment of Complement Factor 2 (C2) was designated C2a. However, complement scientists decided that the smaller of all C fragments should be designated with an 'a', the larger with a 'b', changing the nomenclature for C2. Recent literature may use the updated nomenclature and refer to the larger C2 fragment as C2b, and refer to the classical C3 convertase as C4bC2b. Throughout this pathway Reactome adheres to the original convention to agree with the current (Sep 2013) Uniprot names for C2 fragments. The complement cascade pathway is organised into the following sections: initial triggering, activation of C3 and C5, terminal pathway and regulation.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1799	Costimulation by the CD28 family		Optimal activation of T-lymphocytes requires at least two signals. A primary one is delivered by the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex after antigen recognition and additional costimulatory signals are delivered by the engagement of costimulatory receptors such as CD28. The best-characterized costimulatory pathways are mediated by a set of cosignaling molecules belonging to the CD28 superfamily, including CD28, CTLA4, ICOS, PD1 and BTLA receptors. These proteins deliver both positive and negative second signals to T-cells by interacting with B7 family ligands expressed on antigen presenting cells. Different subsets of T-cells have very different requirements for costimulation. CD28 family mediated costimulation is not required for all T-cell responses in vivo, and alternative costimulatory pathways also exist. Different receptors of the CD28 family and their ligands have different regulation of expression. CD28 is constitutively expressed on naive T cells whereas CTLA4 expression is dependent on CD28/B7 engagement and the other receptor members ICOS, PD1 and BTLA are induced after initial T-cell stimulation. <br>The positive signals induced by CD28 and ICOS molecules are counterbalanced by other members of the CD28 family, including cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen (CTLA)4, programmed cell death (PD)1, and B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), which dampen immune responses. The balance of stimulatory and inhibitory signals is crucial to maximize protective immune responses while maintaining immunological tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. <br>The costimulatory receptors CD28, CTLA4, ICOS and PD1 are composed of single extracellular IgV-like domains, whereas BTLA has one IgC-like domain. Receptors CTLA4, CD28 and ICOS are covalent homodimers, due to an interchain disulphide linkage. The costimulatory ligands B71, B72, B7H2, B7H1 and B7DC, have a membrane proximal IgC-like domain and a membrane distal IgV-like domain that is responsible for receptor binding and dimerization. CD28 and CTLA4 have no known intrinsic enzymatic activity. Instead, engagement by their physiologic ligands B71 and B72 leads to the physical recruitment and activation of downstream T-cell effector molecules.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1802	Dissolution of Fibrin Clot		The crosslinked fibrin multimers in a clot are broken down to soluble polypeptides by plasmin, a serine protease. Plasmin can be generated from its inactive precursor plasminogen and recruited to the site of a fibrin clot in two ways, by interaction with tissue plasminogen activator at the surface of a fibrin clot, and by interaction with urokinase plasminogen activator at a cell surface. The first mechanism appears to be the major one responsible for the dissolution of clots within blood vessels. The second, although capable of mediating clot dissolution, may normally play a major role in tissue remodeling, cell migration, and inflammation (Chapman 1997; Lijnen 2001).<br>Clot dissolution is regulated in two ways. First, efficient plasmin activation and fibrinolysis occur only in complexes formed at the clot surface or on a cell membrane - proteins free in the blood are inefficient catalysts and are rapidly inactivated. Second, both plasminogen activators and plasmin itself are inactivated by specific serpins, proteins that bind to serine proteases to form stable, enzymatically inactive complexes (Kohler and Grant 2000).<br>These events are outlined in the drawing: black arrows connect the substrates (inputs) and products (outputs) of individual reactions, and blue lines connect output activated enzymes to the other reactions that they catalyze.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1803	DNA Damage Bypass		In addition to various processes for removing lesions from the DNA, cells have developed specific mechanisms for tolerating unrepaired damage during the replication of the genome. These mechanisms are collectively called DNA damage bypass pathways. The Y family of DNA polymerases plays a key role in DNA damage bypass. <p>Y family DNA polymerases, REV1, POLH (DNA polymerase eta), POLK (DNA polymerase kappa) and POLI (DNA polymerase iota), as well as the DNA polymerase zeta (POLZ) complex composed of REV3L and MAD2L2, are able to carry out translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) or replicative bypass of damaged bases opposite to template lesions that arrest high fidelity, highly processive replicative DNA polymerase complexes delta (POLD) and epsilon (POLE). REV1, POLH, POLK, POLI and POLZ lack 3'->5' exonuclease activity and exhibit low fidelity and weak processivity. The best established TLS mechanisms are annotated here. TLS details that require substantial experimental clarification have been omitted.

Three enzymes play a major role in reparative DNA dealkylation: MGMT, ALKBH2 and ALKBH3. MGMT dealkylates O-6-methylguanine in a suicidal reaction that inactivates the enzyme (Daniels et al. 2000, Rasimas et al. 2004, Duguid et al. 2005, Tubbs et al. 2007), while ALKBH2 and ALKBH3 dealkylate 1-methyladenine, 3-methyladenine, 3-methylcytosine and 1-ethyladenine (Duncan et al. 2002, Dango et al. 2011).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1809	Effects of PIP2 hydrolysis		Hydrolysis of phosphatidyl inositol-bisphosphate (PIP2) by phospholipase C (PLC) produces diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3). Both are potent second messengers. IP3 diffuses into the cytosol, but as DAG is a hydrophobic lipid it remains within the plasma membrane. IP3 stimulates the release of calcium ions from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, while DAG activates the conventional and unconventional protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, facilitating the translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. The effects of DAG are mimicked by tumor-promoting phorbol esters. DAG is also a precursor for the biosynthesis of prostaglandins, the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol and an activator of a subfamily of TRP-C (Transient Receptor Potential Canonical) cation channels 3, 6, and 7.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1811	Eukaryotic translation elongation		The translation elongation cycle adds one amino acid at a time to a growing polypeptide according to the sequence of codons found in the mRNA. The next available codon on the mRNA is exposed in the aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) binding site (A site) on the 30S subunit.<br>A: Ternary complexes of aa -tRNA:eEF1A:GTP enter the ribosome and  enable the anticodon of the tRNA to make a codon/anticodon interaction with the A-site codon of the mRNA. B: Upon cognate recognition, the eEF1A:GTP is brought into the GTPase activating center of the ribosome, GTP is hydrolyzed and eEF1A:GDP leaves the ribosome. C: The peptidyl transferase center of ribosome catalyses the formation of a peptide bond between the incoming amino acid and the peptide found in the peptidyl-tRNA binding site (P site). D: In the pre-translocation state of the ribosome, the eEF2:GTP enters the ribosome, physically translocating the peptidyl-tRNA out of the A site to P site and leaves the ribosome eEF2:GDP. This action of eEF2:GTP accounts for the precise movement of the mRNA by 3 nucleotides.Consequently, deacylated tRNA is shifted to the E site.  A ribosome associated ATPase activity is proposed to stimulate the release of deacylated tRNA from the E site subsequent to translocation (Elskaya et al., 1991). In this post-translocation state, the ribosome is now ready to receive a new ternary complex.<br>This process is illustrated below with: an amino acyl-tRNA with an amino acid, a peptidyl-tRNA with a growing peptide, a deacylated tRNA with an -OH, and a ribosome with A,P and E sites to accommodate these three forms of tRNA.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1812	Eukaryotic translation initiation		Initiation of translation in the majority of eukaryotic cellular mRNAs depends on the 5'-cap (m7GpppN) and involves ribosomal scanning of the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) for an initiating AUG start codon. Therefore, this mechanism is often called cap-dependent translation initiation. Proximity to the cap, as well as the nucleotides surrounding an AUG codon, influence the efficiency of the start site recognition during the scanning process. However, if the recognition site is poor enough, scanning ribosomal subunits will ignore and skip potential starting AUGs, a phenomenon called leaky scanning. Leaky scanning allows a single mRNA to encode several proteins that differ in their amino-termini. Merrick (2010) provides an overview of this process and hghlights several features of it that remain incompletely understood.<p>Several eukaryotic cell and viral mRNAs initiate translation by an alternative mechanism that involves internal initiation rather than ribosomal scanning. These mRNAs contain complex nucleotide sequences, called internal ribosomal entry sites, where ribosomes bind in a cap-independent manner and start translation at the closest downstream AUG codon.<br>Initiation on several viral and cellular mRNAs is cap-independent and is mediated by binding of the ribosome to internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements. These elements are often found in characteristically long structured regions on the 5'-UTR of an mRNA that may or may not have regulatory upstream open reading frames (uORFs). Both of these features on the 5'-end of the mRNA hinder ribosomal scanning, and thus promote a cap-independent translation initiation mechanism. IRESs act as specific translational enhancers that allow translation initiation to occur in response to specific stimuli and under the control of different trans-acting factors, as for example when cap-dependent protein synthesis is shut off during viral infection. Such regulatory elements have been identified in the mRNAs of growth factors, protooncogenes, angiogenesis factors, and apoptosis regulators, which are translated under a variety of stress conditions, including hypoxia, serum deprivation, irradiation and apoptosis. Thus, cap-independent translational control might have evolved to regulate cellular responses in acute but transient stress conditions that would otherwise lead to cell death, while the same mechanism is of major importance for viral mRNAs to bypass the shutting-off of host protein synthesis after infection. Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and hepatitis C virus exemplify two distinct mechanisms of IRES-mediated initiation. In contrast to cap-dependent initiation, the eIF4A and eIF4G subunits of eIF4F bind immediately upstream of the EMCV initiation codon and promote binding of a 43S complex. Accordingly, EMCV initiation does not involve scanning and does not require eIF1, eIF1A, and the eIF4E subunit of eIF4F. Nonetheless, initiation on some EMCV-like IRESs requires additional non-canonical initiation factors, which alter IRES conformation and promote binding of eIF4A/eIF4G. Initiation on the hepatitis C virus IRES is simpler: a 43S complex containing only eIF2 and eIF3 binds directly to the initiation codon as a result of specific interaction of the IRES and the 40S subunit.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1813	Eukaryotic translation termination		The arrival of any of the three stop codons (UAA, UAG and UGA) into the ribosomal A-site triggers the binding of a release factor (RF) to the ribosome and subsequent polypeptide chain release. In eukaryotes, the RF is composed of two proteins, eRF1 and eRF3. eRF1 is responsible for the hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA, while eRF3 provides a GTP-dependent function. The ribosome releases the mRNA and dissociates into its two complex subunits, which can reassemble on another molecule to begin a new round of protein synthesis. It should be noted that at present, there is no factor identified in eukaryotes that would be the functional equivalent of the bacterial ribosome release (or recycling) factor, RRF, that catalyzes dissociation of the ribosome from the mRNA following release of the polypeptide View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=72764 Reactome].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1815	Factors involved in megakaryocyte development and platelet production		Megakaryocytes (MKs) give rise to circulating platelets (thrombocytes) through terminal differentiation of MKs which release cytoplasmic fragments as circulating platelets. As MKs mature they undergo endoreduplication (polyploidisation) and expansion of cytoplasmic mass to cell sizes larger than 50-100 microns, and ploidy ranges up to 128 N. As MKs mature, the polyploid nucleus becomes horseshoe-shaped, the cytoplasm expands, and platelet organelles and the demarcation membrane system are amplified. Proplatelet projections form which give rise to de novo circulating platelets (Deutsch & Tomer 2006).  <br>The processes of megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production occur within a complex microenvironment where chemokines, cytokines and adhesive interactions play major roles (Avecilla et al. 2004). Megakaryocytopoiesis is regulated at several levels including proliferation, differentiation and platelet release (Kaushansky 2003). Thrombopoietin (TPO/c-Mpl ligand) is the most potent cytokine stimulating proliferation and maturation of MK progenitors (Kaushansky 2005) but many other growth factors are involved. MK development is controlled by the action of multiple transcription factors. Many MK-specific genes are co-regulated by GATA and friend of GATA (FOG), RUNX1 and ETS proteins. Nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2), which has an MK-erythroid specific 45-kDa subunit, controls terminal MK maturation, proplatelet formation and platelet release (Schulze & Shivdasani 2004). NF-E2 deficient mice have profound thrombocytopenia (Shiraga et al. 1999). MYB (c-myb) functions with EP300 (p300) as a negative regulator of thrombopoiesis (Metcalf et al. 2005). During MK maturation, internal membrane systems, granules and organelles are assembled. Cytoplasmic fragmentation requires changes in the MK cytoskeleton and formation of organelles and channels. Individual organelles migrate from the cell body to the proplatelet ends, with approximately 30 percent of organelles/granules in motion at any given time (Richardson et al. 2005).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1818	Formation of Fibrin Clot and the Clotting Cascade		The formation of a fibrin clot at the site of an injury to the wall of a normal blood vessel is an essential part of the process to stop blood loss after vascular injury.  The reactions that lead to fibrin clot formation are commonly described as a cascade, in which the product of each step is an enzyme or cofactor needed for following reactions to proceed efficiently.  The entire clotting cascade can be divided into three portions, the extrinsic pathway, the intrinsic pathway, and the common pathway.  The extrinsic pathway begins with the release of tissue factor at the site of vascular injury and leads to the activation of factor X.  The intrinsic pathway provides an alternative mechanism for activation of factor X, starting from the activation of factor XII.  The common pathway consists of the steps linking the activation of factor X to the formation of a multimeric, cross-linked fibrin clot.  Each of these pathways includes not only a cascade of events that generate the catalytic activities needed for clot formation, but also numerous positive and negative regulatory events.

Each connexon is composed of 6  trans-membrane protein subunits of the connexin (Cx) family.  A gap of approximately 3 nm remains between the adjacent cell membranes, but two connexons interact and dock head-to-head in the extra-cellular space forming a tightly sealed, double-membrane intercellular channel (see Segretain and Falk, 2004).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1822	Generic transcription pathway		"<b>OVERVIEW OF TRANSCRIPTION REGULATION:</b>  <br><br>Detailed studies of gene transcription regulation in a wide variety of eukaryotic systems has revealed the general principles and mechanisms by which cell- or tissue-specific regulation of differential gene transcription is mediated (reviewed in Naar, 2001. Kadonaga, 2004, Maston, 2006, Barolo, 2002; Roeder, 2005, Rosenfeld, 2006).  Of the three major classes of DNA polymerase involved in eukaryotic gene transcription, Polymerase II generally regulates protein-encoding genes.   Figure 1 shows a diagram of the various components involved in cell-specific regulation of Pol-II gene transcription. <br><br>Core Promoter: Pol II-regulated genes typically have a Core Promoter where Pol II and a variety of general factors bind to specific DNA motifs: <br>   i: the TATA box (TATA DNA sequence), which is bound by the ""TATA-binding protein"" (TBP).<br>   ii: the Initiator motif (INR), where Pol II and certain other core factors bind, is present in many Pol II-regulated genes.<br>   iii: the Downstream Promoter Element (DPE), which is present in a subset of Pol II genes, and where additional core factors bind.  <br>The core promoter binding factors are generally ubiquitously expressed, although there are exceptions to this.<br><br>Proximal Promoter: immediately upstream (5') of the core promoter, Pol II target genes often have a Proximal Promoter region that spans up to 500 base pairs (b.p.), or even to 1000 b.p..  This region contains a number of functional DNA binding sites for a specific set of transcription activator (TA) and transcription repressor (TR) proteins.  These TA and TR factors are generally cell- or tissue-specific in expression, rather than ubiquitous, so that the presence of their cognate binding sites in the proximal promoter region programs cell- or tissue-specific expression of the target gene, perhaps in conjunction with TA and TR complexes bound in distal enhancer regions.  <br><br>Distal Enhancer(s): many or most Pol II regulated genes in higher eukaryotes have one or more distal Enhancer regions which are essential for proper regulation of the gene, often in a cell or tissue-specific pattern.  Like the proximal promoter region, each of the distal enhancer regions typically contain a cluster of binding sites for specific TA and/or TR DNA-binding factors, rather than just a single site. <br><br>   Enhancers generally have three defining characteristics:<br>     i: They can be located very long distances from the promoter of the target gene they regulate, sometimes as far as 100 Kb, or more.<br>     ii: They can be either upstream (5') or downstream (3') of the target gene, including within introns of that gene.<br>     iii: They can function in either orientation in the DNA.<br><br>Combinatorial mechanisms of transcription regulation: The specific combination of TA and TR binding sites within the proximal promoter and/or distal enhancer(s) provides a ""combinatorial transcription code"" that mediates cell- or tissue-specific expression of the associated target gene.  Each promoter or enhancer region mediates expression in a specific subset of the overall expression pattern.  In at least some cases, each enhancer region functions completely independently of the others, so that the overall expression pattern is a linear combination of the expression patterns of each of the enhancer modules.<br><br>Co-Activator and Co-Repressor Complexes:  DNA-bound TA and TR proteins typically recruit the assembly of specific Co-Activator (Co-A) and Co-Repressor (Co-R) Complexes, respectively, which are essential for regulating target gene transcription.  Both Co-A's and Co-R's  are multi-protein complexes that contain several specific protein components.<br><br>Co-Activator complexes generally contain at lease one component protein that has Histone Acetyl Transferase (HAT) enzymatic activity.  This functions to acetylate Histones and/or other chromatin-associated factors, which typically increases that transcription activation of the target gene.  By contrast, Co-Repressor complexes generally contain at lease one component protein that has Histone De-Acetylase (HDAC) enzymatic activity.  This functions to de-acetylate Histones and/or other chromatin-associated factors. This typically increases the transcription repression of the target gene.<br><br>Adaptor (Mediator) complexes: In addition to the co-activator complexes that assemble on particular cell-specific TA factors,  - there are at least two additional transcriptional co-activator complexes common to most cells.  One of these is the Mediator complex, which functions as an ""adaptor"" complex that bridges between the tissue-specific co-activator complexes assembled in the proximal promoter (or distal enhancers).  The human Mediator complex has been shown to contain at least 19 protein distinct components.  Different combinations of these co-activator proteins are also found to be components of specific transcription Co-Activator complexes, such as the DRIP, TRAP and ARC complexes described below.  <br><br>TBP/TAF complex: Another large Co-A complex is the ""TBP-associated factors"" (TAFs) that assemble on TBP (TATA-Binding Protein), which is bound to the TATA box present in many promoters.  There are at least 23 human TAF proteins that have been identified.  Many of these are ubiquitously expressed, but TAFs can also be expressed in a cell or tissue-specific pattern.  <br><br><b>	Specific Coactivator Complexes for DNA-binding Transcription Factors.</b>   <br><br>A number of specific co-activator complexes for DNA-binding transcription factors have been identified, including DRIP, TRAP, and ARC (reviewed in Bourbon, 2004, Blazek, 2005, Conaway, 2005, and Malik, 2005).  The DRIP co-activator complex was originally identified and named as a specific complex associated with the Vitamin D Receptor member of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors (Rachez, 1998).  Similarly, the TRAP co-activator complex was originally identified as a complex that associates with the thyroid receptor (Yuan, 1998).   It was later determined that all of the components of the DRIP complex are also present in the TRAP complex, and the ARC complex (discussed further below).  For example, the DRIP205 and TRAP220 proteins were show to be identical, as were specific pairs of the other components of these complexes (Rachez, 1999).<br><br>In addition, these various transcription co-activator proteins identified in mammalian cells were found to be the orthologues or homologues of the Mediator (""adaptor"") complex proteins (reviewed in Bourbon, 2004).  The Mediator proteins were originally identified in yeast  by Kornberg and colleagues, as complexes associated with DNA polymerase (Kelleher, 1990).  In higher organisms, Adapter complexes bridge between the basal transcription factors (including Pol II) and tissue-specific transcription factors (TFs) bound to sites within upstream Proximal Promoter regions or distal Enhancer regions (Figure 1).  However, many of the Mediator homologues can also be found in complexes associated with specific transcription factors in higher organisms.  A unified nomenclature system for these adapter / co-activator proteins now labels them Mediator 1 through Mediator 31 (Bourbon, 2004).  For example, the DRIP205 / TRAP220 proteins are now identified as Mediator 1 (Rachez, 1999), based on homology with yeast Mediator 1.<br><br><b>Example Pathway: Specific Regulation of Target Genes During Notch Signaling:</b> <br><br>One well-studied example of cell-specific regulation of gene transcription is selective regulation of target genes during Notch signaling.  Notch signaling was first identified in Drosophila, where it has been studied in detail at the genetic, molecular, biochemical and cellular levels (reviewed in Justice, 2002; Bray, 2006; Schweisguth, 2004; Louvri, 2006).  In Drosophila, Notch signaling to the nucleus is thought always to be mediated by one specific DNA binding transcription factor, Suppressor of Hairless.  In mammals, the homologous genes are called CBF1 (or RBPJkappa), while in worms they are called Lag-1, so that the acronym ""CSL"" has been given to this conserved transcription factor family.  There are at least two human CSL homologues, which are now named RBPJ and RBPJL.  <br><br>In Drosophila, Su(H) is known to be bifunctional, in that it represses target gene transcription in the absence of Notch signaling, but activates target genes during Notch signaling.  At least some of the mammalian CSL homologues are believed also to be bifunctional, and to mediate target gene repression in the absence of Notch signaling, and activation in the presence of Notch signaling.<br><br>Notch Co-Activator and Co-Repressor complexes: This repression is mediated by at least one specific co-repressor complexes (Co-R) bound to CSL in the absence of Notch signaling.  In Drosophila, this co-repressor complex consists of at least three distinct co-repressor proteins: Hairless, Groucho, and dCtBP (Drosophila C-terminal Binding Protein).  Hairless has been show to bind directly to Su(H), and Groucho and dCtBP have been shown to bind directly to Hairless (Barolo, 2002).  All three of the co-repressor proteins have been shown to be necessary for proper gene regulation during Notch signaling in vivo (Nagel, 2005).<br><br>In mammals, the same general pathway and mechanisms are observed, where CSL proteins are bifunctional DNA binding transcription factors (TFs), that bind to Co-Repressor complexes to mediate repression in the absence of Notch signaling, and bind to Co-Activator  complexes to mediate activation in the presence of Notch signaling.  However, in mammals, there may be multiple co-repressor complexes, rather than the single Hairless co-repressor complex that has been observed in Drosophila.  <br><br>During Notch signaling in all systems, the Notch transmembrane receptor is cleaved and the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) translocates to the nucleus, where it there functions as a specific transcription co-activator for CSL proteins.  In the nucleus, NICD replaces the Co-R complex bound to CSL, thus resulting in de-repression of  Notch target genes in the nucleus (Figure 2).  Once bound to CSL, NICD and CSL proteins recruit an additional co-activator protein, Mastermind, to form a CSL-NICD-Mam ternary co-activator (Co-A) complex.  This Co-R  complex was initially thought to be sufficient to mediate activation of  at least some Notch target genes.  However, there now is evidence that still other co-activators and additional DNA-binding transcription factors are required in at least some contexts (reviewed in Barolo, 2002).  <br><br>Thus, CSL is a good example of a bifunctional DNA-binding transcription factor that mediates repression of specific targets genes in one context, but activation of the same targets in another context.  This bifunctionality is mediated by the association of specific Co-Repressor complexes vs. specific Co-Activator complexes in different contexts, namely in the absence or presence of Notch signaling.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1823	GP1b-IX-V activation signaling		The platelet GPIb complex (GP1b-IX-V) together with GPVI are primarily responsible for regulating the initial adhesion of platelets to the damaged blood vessel and platelet activation. The importance of GPIb is demonstrated by the bleeding problems in patients with Bernard-Soulier syndrome where this receptor is either absent or defective. GP1b-IX-V binds von Willebrand Factor (vWF) to resting platelets, particularly under conditions of high shear stress. This transient interaction is the first stage of the vascular repair process. Activation of GP1b-IX-V on exposure of the fibrous matrix following atherosclerotic plaque rupture, or in occluded arteries, is a major contributory factor leading to thrombus formation leading to heart attack or stroke.GpIb also binds thrombin (Yamamoto et al. 1986), at a site distinct from the site of vWF binding, acting as a docking site for thrombin which then activates Proteinase Activated Receptors leading to enhanced platelet activation (Dormann et al. 2000).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1826	GPVI-mediated activation cascade		The GPVI receptor is a complex of the GPVI protein with Fc epsilon R1 gamma (FcR). The Src family kinases Fyn and Lyn constitutively associate with the GPVI-FcR complex in platelets and initiate platelet activation through phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in the FcR gamma chain, leading to binding and activation of the tyrosine kinase Syk. Downstream of Syk, a series of adapter molecules and effectors lead to platelet activation. <br><br>The GPVI receptor signaling cascade is similar to that of T- and B-cell immune receptors, involving the formation of a signalosome composed of adapter and effector proteins. At the core of the T-cell receptor signalosome is the transmembrane adapter LAT and two cytosolic adapters SLP-76 and Gads. While LAT is essential for signalling to PLCgamma1 downstream of the T-cell receptor, the absence of LAT in platelets only impairs the activation of PLCgamma2, the response to collagen and GPVI receptor ligands remains sufficient to elicit a full aggregation response. In contrast, GPVI signalling is almost entirely abolished in the absence of SLP-76. View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=114604 Reactome].		9606

Somatic cells are also able to report internal functional impairment by displaying surface stress markers such as MICA. The presence of these molecules on somatic cells is picked up by C-lectin NK immune receptors.<p><p>Lymphoid cells are able to regulate their location and movement in accordance to their state of activation, and home in on tissues expressing the appropriate complementary ligands. For example, lymphoid cells may fine tune the presence and concentration of adhesion molecules belonging to the IgSF, Selectin and Integrin class that interact with a number of vascular markers of inflammation.<p><p>Furthermore, there are a number of avenues through which lymphoid cells may interact with antigen. This may be presented directly to a specific T-cell receptor in the context of an MHC molecule. Antigen-antibody complexes may anchor to the cell via a small number of lymphoid-specific Fc receptors that may, in turn, influence cell function further. Activated complement factor C3d binds to both antigen and to cell surface receptor CD21. In such cases, the far-reaching influence of CD19 on B-lymphocyte function is tempered by its interaction with CD21.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1831	Integration of energy metabolism		Many hormones that affect individual physiological processes including the regulation of appetite, absorption, transport, and oxidation of foodstuffs influence energy metabolism pathways. While <b>insulin</b> mediates the storage of excess nutrients, <b>glucagon</b> is involved in the mobilization of energy resources in response to low blood glucose levels, principally by stimulating hepatic glucose output. Small doses of glucagon are sufficient to induce significant glucose elevations. These hormone-driven regulatory pathways enable the body to sense and respond to changed amounts of nutrients in the blood and demands for energy.<br>Glucagon and Insulin act through various metabolites and enzymes that target specific steps in metabolic pathways for sugar and fatty acids. The processes responsible for the long-term control of fat synthesis and short term control of glycolysis by key metabolic products and enzymes are annotated in this module as six specific pathways:<br><b>Pathway 1. Glucagon signalling in metabolic pathways:</b> In response to low blood glucose, pancreatic alpha-cells release glucagon. The binding of glucagon to its receptor results in increased cAMP synthesis, and Protein Kinase A (PKA) activation.<br><b>Pathway 2. PKA mediated phosphorylation:</b>PKA phosphorylates key enzymes, e.g., 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase /Fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PF2K-Pase) at serine 36, and regulatory proteins, e.g., Carbohydrate Response Element Binding Protein (ChREBP) at serine 196 and threonine 666.<br>In brief, the binding of insulin to its receptor leads to increased protein phosphatase activity and to hydrolysis of cAMP by cAMP phosphodiesterase. These events counteract the regulatory effects of glucagon.<br><b>Pathway 3: Insulin stimulates increased synthesis of Xylulose-5-phosphate (Xy-5-P)</b>. Activation of the insulin receptor results indirectly in increased Xy-5-P synthesis from Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and Fructose-6-phosphate. Xy-5-P, a metabolite of the pentose phosphate pathway, stimulates protein phosphatase  PP2A.<br><b>Pathway 4: AMP Kinase (AMPK) mediated response to high AMP:ATP ratio:</b> In response to diet with high fat content or low energy levels, the cytosolic AMP:ATP ratio is increased. AMP triggers a complicated  cascade of events. In this module we have annotated only the phosphorylation of ChREBP by AMPK  at serine 568, which inactivates this transcription factor.<br><b>Pathway 5: Dephosphorylation of key metabolic factors by PP2A: </b>Xy-5-P activated PP2A efficiently dephosphorylates phosphorylated PF2K-Pase resulting in the higher output of F-2,6-P2 that enhances PFK activity in the glycolytic pathway. PP2A also dephosphorylates (and thus activates) cytosolic and nuclear ChREBP.<br><b>Pathway 6: Transcriptional activation of metabolic genes by ChREBP:</b> Dephosphorylated ChREBP activates the transcription of genes involved in glucose metabolism such as pyruvate kinase, and lipogenic genes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthetase, acyl CoA synthase and glycerol phosphate acyl transferase.<br> The illustration below summarizes this network of events.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1835	Interferon alpha/beta signaling		Type I interferons (IFNs) are composed of various genes including IFN alpha (IFNA), beta (IFNB), omega, epsilon, and kappa. In humans the IFNA genes are composed of more than 13 subfamily genes, whereas there is only one IFNB gene. The large family of IFNA/B proteins all bind to a single receptor which is composed of two distinct chains: IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. The IFNA/B stimulation of the IFNA receptor complex leads to the formation of two transcriptional activator complexes: IFNA-activated-factor (AAF), which is a homodimer of STAT1 and IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which comprises STAT1, STAT2 and a member of the IRF family, IRF9/P48. AAF mediates activation of the IRF-1 gene by binding to GAS (IFNG-activated site), whereas ISGF3 activates several IFN-inducible genes including IRF3 and IRF7.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1836	Interferon gamma signaling		Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) belongs to the type II interferon family and is secreted by activated immune cells-primarily T and NK cells, but also B-cells and APC. INFG exerts its effect on cells by interacting with the specific IFN-gamma receptor (IFNGR). IFNGR consists of two chains, namely IFNGR1 (also known as the IFNGR alpha chain) and IFNGR2 (also known as the IFNGR beta chain). IFNGR1 is the ligand binding receptor and is required but not sufficient for signal transduction, whereas IFNGR2 do not bind IFNG independently but mainly plays a role in IFNG signaling and is generally the limiting factor in IFNG responsiveness. Both IFNGR chains lack intrinsic kinase/phosphatase activity and thus rely on other signaling proteins like Janus-activated kinase 1 (JAK1), JAK2 and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT-1) for signal transduction. IFNGR complex in its resting state is a preformed tetramer and upon IFNG association undergoes a conformational change. This conformational change induces the phosphorylation and activation of JAK1, JAK2, and STAT1 which in turn induces genes containing the gamma-interferon activation sequence (GAS) in the promoter.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1838	Interleukin-1 processing		The IL-1 family of cytokines that interact with the Type 1 IL-1R include IL-1Î± (IL1A), IL-1Î² (IL1B) and the IL-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL1RAP). IL1RAP is synthesized with a signal peptide and secreted as a mature protein via the classical secretory pathway.  IL1A and IL1B are synthesised as cytoplasmic precursors (pro-IL1A and pro-IL1B) in activated cells. They have no signal sequence, precluding secretion via the classical ER-Golgi route (Rubartelli et al. 1990). Processing of pro-IL1B to the active form requires caspase-1 (Thornberry et al. 1992), which is itself activated by a molecular scaffold termed the inflammasome (Martinon et al. 2002). Processing and release of IL1B are thought to be closely linked, because mature IL1B is only seen inside inflammatory cells just prior to release (Brough et al. 2003). It has been reported that in monocytes a fraction of cellular IL1B is released by the regulated secretion of late endosomes and early lysosomes, and that this may represent a cellular compartment where caspase-1 processing of pro-IL1B takes place (Andrei et al. 1999). Shedding of microvesicles from the plasma membrane has also been proposed as a mechanism of secretion (MacKenzie et al. 2001). These proposals superceded previous models in which non-specific release due to cell lysis and passage through a plasma membrane pore were considered. However, there is evidence in the literature that supports all of these mechanisms and there is still controversy over how IL1B exits from cells (Brough & Rothwell 2007). A calpain-like potease has been reported to be important for the processing of  pro-IL1A, but much less is known about how IL1A is released from cells and what specific roles it plays in biology.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1839	Interleukin-1 family signaling		The Interleukin-1 (IL1) family of cytokines comprises 11 members, namely Interleukin-1 alpha (IL1A), Interleukin-1 beta (IL1B), Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL1RN, IL1RA), Interleukin-18 (IL18), Interleukin-33 (IL33), Interleukin-36 receptor antagonist protein (IL36RN, IL36RA), Interleukin-36 alpha (IL36A), Interleukin-36 beta (IL36B), Interleukin-36 gamma (IL36G), Interleukin-37 (IL37) and Interleukin-38 (IL38). The genes encoding all except IL18 and IL33 are on chromosome 2. They share a common C-terminal three-dimensional structure and  with apart from  IL1RN they are synthesized without a hydrophobic leader sequence and are not secreted via the classical reticulum endoplasmic-Golgi pathway.IL1B and IL18, are produced as biologically inactive propeptides that are cleaved to produce the mature, active interleukin peptide.The IL1 receptor (IL1R) family comprises 10 members: Interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL1R1, IL1RA), Interleukin-1 receptor type 2 (IL1R2, IL1RB), Interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP, IL1RAcP, IL1R3), Interleukin-18 receptor 1 (IL18R1, IL18RA) , Interleukin-18 receptor accessory protein (IL18RAP, IL18RB), Interleukin-1 receptor-like 1 (IL1RL1, ST2, IL33R), Interleukin-1 receptor-like 2 (IL1RL2, IL36R), Single Ig IL-1-related receptor (SIGIRR, TIR8), Interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein-like 1 (IL1RAPL1, TIGGIR2) and X-linked interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein-like 2 (IL1RAPL2, TIGGIR1). Most of the genes encoding these receptors are on chromosome 2. IL1 family receptors heterodimerize upon cytokine binding. IL1, IL33 and IL36 bind specific receptors, IL1R1, IL1RL1, and IL1RL2 respectively.  All use IL1RAP as a co-receptor. IL18 binds IL18R1 and uses IL18RAP as co-receptor.The complexes formed by IL1 family cytokines and their heterodimeric receptors recruit intracellular signaling molecules, including Myeloid differentiation primary response protein MyD88 (MYD88), members of he IL1R-associated kinase (IRAK) family, and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), activating Nuclear factor NF-kappa-B (NFÎºB), as well as Mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14, p38), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and other Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1840	Interleukin-3, Interleukin-5 and GM-CSF signaling		The Interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-5 and Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptors form a family of heterodimeric receptors that have specific alpha chains but share a common beta subunit, often referred to as the common beta (Bc). Both subunits contain extracellular conserved motifs typical of the cytokine receptor superfamily. The cytoplasmic domains have limited similarity with other cytokine receptors and lack detectable catalytic domains such as tyrosine kinase domains.<br><br> IL-3 is a 20-26 kDa product of CD4+ T cells that acts on the most immature marrow progenitors. IL-3 is capable of inducing the growth and differentiation of multi-potential hematopoietic stem cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, macrophages, lymphoid and erythroid cells. IL-3 has been used to support the proliferation of murine cell lines with properties of multi-potential progenitors, immature myeloid as well as T and pre-B lymphoid cells (Miyajima et al. 1992). IL-5 is a hematopoietic growth factor responsible for the maturation and differentiation of eosinophils. It was originally defined as a T-cell-derived cytokine that triggers activated B cells for terminal differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells. It also promotes the generation of cytotoxic T-cells from thymocytes. IL-5 induces the expression of IL-2 receptors (Kouro & Takatsu 2009). GM-CSF is produced by cells (T-lymphocytes, tissue macrophages, endothelial cells, mast cells) found at sites of inflammatory responses. It stimulates the growth and development of progenitors of granulocytes and macrophages, and the production and maturation of dendritic cells. It stimulates myeloblast and monoblast differentiation, synergises with Epo in the proliferation of erythroid and megakaryocytic  progenitor cells, acts as an autocrine mediator of growth for some types of acute myeloid leukemia, is a strong chemoattractant for neutrophils and eosinophils. It enhances the activity of neutrophils and macrophages. Under steady-state conditions GM-CSF is not essential for the production of myeloid cells, but it is required for the proper development of alveolar macrophages, otherwise, pulmonary alvelolar proteinosis (PAP) develops. A growing body of evidence suggests that GM-CSF plays a key role in emergency hematopoiesis (predominantly myelopoiesis)  in response to infection, including the production of granulocytes and macrophages in the bone marrow and their maintenance, survival, and functional activation at sites of injury or insult  (Hercus et al. 2009).<br><br> All three receptors have alpha chains that bind their specific ligands with low affinity (de Groot et al. 1998). Bc then associates with the alpha chain forming a high affinity receptor (Geijsen et al. 2001), though the in vivo receptor is likely be a higher order multimer as recently demonstrated for the GM-CSF receptor (Hansen et al. 2008).<br><br> The receptor chains lack intrinsic kinase activity, instead they interact with and activate signaling kinases, notably Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2). These phosphorylate the common beta subunit, allowing recruitment of signaling molecules such as Shc, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks), and the Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs). The cytoplasmic domain of Bc has two distinct functional domains: the membrane proximal region mediates the induction of proliferation-associated genes such as c-myc, pim-1 and oncostatin M. This region binds multiple signal-transducing proteins including JAK2 (Quelle et al. 1994), STATs, c-Src and PI3 kinase (Rao and Mufson, 1995). The membrane distal domain is required for cytokine-induced growth inhibition and is necessary for the viability of hematopoietic cells (Inhorn et al. 1995). This region interacts with signal-transducing proteins such as Shc (Inhorn et al. 1995) and SHP and mediates the transcriptional activation of c-fos, c-jun, c-Raf and p70S6K (Reddy et al. 2000).<br><br><br><br>Figure reproduced by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd: Leukemia, WL Blalock et al. 13:1109-1166, copyright 1999.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1841	Intrinsic Pathway for Apoptosis		"The intrinsic (Bcl-2 inhibitable or mitochondrial) pathway of apoptosis functions in response to various types of intracellular stress including growth factor withdrawal, DNA damage, unfolding stresses in the endoplasmic reticulum and death receptor stimulation. Following the reception of stress signals, proapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins are activated and subsequently interact with and inactivate antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins. This interaction leads to the destabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and release of apoptotic factors.  These factors induce the caspase proteolytic cascade, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation, ultimately leading to cell death. The key players in the Intrinsic pathway are the Bcl-2 family of proteins that are critical death regulators residing immediately upstream of mitochondria. The Bcl-2 family consists of both anti- and proapoptotic members that possess conserved alpha-helices with sequence conservation clustered in BCL-2 Homology (BH) domains. Proapoptotic members are organized as follows: <p> 1. ""Multidomain"" BAX family proteins such as BAX, BAK etc. that display sequence conservation in their BH1-3 regions. These proteins act downstream in mitochondrial disruption. <p> 2. ""BH3-only"" proteins such as BID,BAD, NOXA, PUMA,BIM, and BMF have only the short BH3 motif. These act upstream in the pathway, detecting developmental death cues or intracellular damage. Anti-apoptotic members like Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and their relatives exhibit homology in all segments BH1-4. One of the critical functions of BCL-2/BCL-XL proteins is to maintain the integrity of the mitochondrial outer membrane.

These CAMs contain six Ig like domains, five or six fibronectin like repeats, a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic domain. The L1CAM family has been implicated in processes integral to nervous system development, including neurite outgrowth, neurite fasciculation and inter neuronal adhesion.<br>L1CAM members are predominately expressed by neuronal, as well as some nonneuronal cells, during development.  Except CHL1 all the other members of L1 family contain an alternatively spliced 12-nclueotide exon, encoding the amino acid residues RSLE in the neuronal splice forms but missing in the non-neuronal cells. The extracellular regions of L1CAM members are divergent and differ in their abilities to interact with extracellular, heterophilic ligands. The L1 ligands include other Ig-domain CAMs (such as NCAM, TAG-1/axonin and F11), proteoglycans type molecules (neurocan), beta1 integrins, and extra cellular matrix protein laminin, Neuropilin-1, FGF and EGF receptors. Some of these L1-interacting proteins also bind to other L1CAM members. For example TAG-1/axonin interact with L1 and NrCAM; L1, neurofascin and CHL1 binds to contactin family members. The cytoplasmic domains of L1CAM members are most highly conserved. Nevertheless, they have different cytoplasmic binding partners, and even those with similar binding partners may be involved in different signaling complexes and mechanisms. The most conserved feature of L1CAMs is their ability to interact with the actin cytoskeletal adapter protein ankyrin. The cytoplasmic ankyrin-binding domain, exhibits the highest degree of amino acid conservation throughout the L1 family.

Active RSKs translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates such factors as c-Fos(on Ser362), SRF (Serum Response Factor) at Ser103, and CREB (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding protein) at Ser133. In the nucleus activated ERKs phosphorylate many other targets such as MSKs (Mitogen- and Stress-activated protein kinases), MNK (MAP interacting kinase) and Elk1 (on Serine383 and Serine389). ERK can directly phosphorylate CREB and  also AP-1 components c-Jun and c-Fos.  Another important target of ERK is NF-KappaB. Recent studies reveals that nuclear pore proteins are direct substrates for ERK (Kosako H et al, 2009).

Other JNK targets are heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP-K) and the Pol I-specific transcription factor TIF-IA, which regulates ribosome synthesis.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1850	Metabolism of nitric oxide: NOS3 activation and regulation		Nitric oxide (NO), a multifunctional second messenger, is implicated in physiological processes in mammals that range from immune response and potentiation of synaptic transmission to dilation of blood vessels and muscle relaxation. NO is a highly active molecule that diffuses across cell membranes and cannot be stored inside the producing cell. Its signaling capacity is controlled at the levels of biosynthesis and local availability. Its production by NO synthases is under complex and tight control, being regulated at transcriptional and translational levels, through co- and posttranslational modifications, and by subcellular localization. NO is synthesized from L-arginine by a family of nitric oxide synthases (NOS). Three NOS isoforms have been characterized: neuronal NOS (nNOS, NOS1) primarily found in neuronal tissue and skeletal muscle; inducible NOS (iNOS, NOS2) originally isolated from macrophages and later discovered in many other cell types; and endothelial NOS (eNOS, NOS3) present in vascular endothelial cells, cardiac myocytes, and in blood platelets. The enzymatic activity of all three isoforms is dependent on calmodulin, which binds to nNOS and eNOS at elevated intracellular calcium levels, while it is tightly associated with iNOS even at basal calcium levels. As a result, the enzymatic activity of nNOS and eNOS is modulated by changes in intracellular calcium levels, leading to transient NO production, while iNOS continuously releases NO independent of fluctuations in intracellular calcium levels and is mainly regulated at the gene expression level (Pacher et al. 2007).<p>The NOS enzymes share a common basic structural organization and requirement for substrate cofactors for enzymatic activity. A central calmodulin-binding motif separates an NH2-terminal oxygenase domain from a COOH-terminal reductase domain. Binding sites for cofactors NADPH, FAD, and FMN are located within the reductase domain, while binding sites for tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and heme are located within the oxygenase domain. Once calmodulin binds, it facilitates electron transfer from the cofactors in the reductase domain to heme enabling nitric oxide production. Both nNOS and eNOS contain an additional insert (40-50 amino acids) in the middle of the FMN-binding subdomain that serves as autoinhibitory loop, destabilizing calmodulin binding at low calcium levels and inhibiting electron transfer from FMN to the heme in the absence of calmodulin.  iNOS does not contain this insert. <p>In this Reactome pathway module, details of eNOS activation and regulation are annotated. Originally identified as endothelium-derived relaxing factor, eNOS derived NO is a critical signaling molecule in vascular homeostasis. It regulates blood pressure and vascular tone, and is involved in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, platelet aggregation, and leukocyte adhesion. Loss of endothelium derived NO is a key feature of endothelial dysfunction, implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension and atherosclerosis. The endothelial isoform eNOS is unique among the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) family in that it is co-translationally modified at its amino terminus by myristoylation and is further acylated by palmitoylation (two residues next to the myristoylation site). These modifications target eNOS to the plasma membrane caveolae and lipid rafts. <p>Factors that stimulate eNOS activation and nitric oxide (NO) production include fluid shear stress generated by blood flow, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), bradykinin, estrogen, insulin, and angiopoietin. The activity of eNOS is further regulated by numerous post-translational modifications, including protein-protein interactions, phosphorylation, and subcellular localization. <p>Following activation, eNOS shuttles between caveolae and other subcellular compartments such as the noncaveolar plasma membrane portions, Golgi apparatus, and perinuclear structures. This subcellular distribution is variable depending upon cell type and mode of activation. <p>Subcellular localization of eNOS has a profound effect on its ability to produce NO as the availability of its substrates and cofactors will vary with location. eNOS is primarily particulate, and depending on the cell type, eNOS can be found in several membrane compartments:  plasma membrane caveolae, lipid rafts, and intracellular membranes such as the Golgi complex.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1852	Metabolism of porphyrins		Porphyrins are heterocyclic macrocycles, consisting of four pyrrole subunits (tetrapyrrole) linked by four methine (=CH-) bridges. The extensive conjugated porphyrin macrocycle is chromatic and the name itself, <b>porphyrin</b>, is derived from the Greek word for <i>purple</i>. The aromatic character of porphyrins can be seen by NMR spectroscopy.<br>Porphyrins readily combine with metals by coordinating them in the central cavity. Iron (heme) and magnesium (chlorophyll) are two well known examples although zinc, copper, nickel and cobalt form other known metal-containing phorphyrins. A porphyrin which has no metal in the cavity is called a <i>free base</i>.<br>Some iron-containing porphyrins are called hemes (heme-containing proteins or hemoproteins) and these are found extensively in nature ie. hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is quantitatively the most important hemoprotein. The hemoglobin iron is the transfer site of oxygen and carries it in the blood all round the body for cell respiration. Other examples are cytochromes present in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum which takes part in electron transfer events, catalase and peroxidase whic protect the body against the oxidant hydrogen peroxide and tryptophan oxygenase which is present in intermediary metabolism. Hemoproteins are synthesized in all mammalian cells and the major sites are erythropoietic tissue and the liver.<p>The processes by which heme is synthesized, transported, and metabolized are a critical part of human iron metabolism (Severance and Hamze 2009); here the core processes of heme biosynthesis and catabolism have been annotated.

They have distinct biochemical roles, often as coenzymes, and are either not synthesized or synthesized only in limited amounts by human cells. Vitamins are classified according to their solubility, either fat-soluble or water-soluble. The physiological processes dependent on vitamin-requiring reactions include many aspects of intermediary metabolism, vision, bone formation, and blood coagulation, and vitamin deficiencies are associated with a correspondingly diverse and severe group of diseases.<p>Water-soluble vitamins include ascorbate (vitamin C) and the members of the B group: thiamin (vitamin B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenate (B5), pyridoxine (B6), biotin (B7), folate (B9), and cobalamin (B12).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1858	Mitotic G1 phase and G1/S transition		Mitotic G1-G1/S phase involves G1 phase of the mitotic interphase and G1/S transition, when a cell commits to DNA replication and divison genetic and cellular material to two daughter cells.<p>During early G1, cells can enter a quiescent G0 state. In quiescent cells, the evolutionarily conserved DREAM complex, consisting of the pocket protein family member p130 (RBL2), bound to E2F4 or E2F5, and the MuvB complex, represses transcription of cell cycle genes (reviewed by Sadasivam and DeCaprio 2013).<p>During early G1 phase in actively cycling cells, transcription of cell cycle genes is repressed by another pocket protein family member, p107 (RBL1), which forms a complex with E2F4 (Ferreira et al. 1998, Cobrinik 2005). RB1 tumor suppressor, the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, is the third member of the pocket protein family. RB1 binds to E2F transcription factors E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3 and inhibits their transcriptional activity, resulting in prevention of G1/S transition (Chellappan et al. 1991, Bagchi et al. 1991, Chittenden et al. 1991, Lees et al. 1993, Hiebert 1993, Wu et al. 2001). Once RB1 is phosphorylated on serine residue S795 by Cyclin D:CDK4/6 complexes, it can no longer associate with and inhibit E2F1-3. Thus, CDK4/6-mediated phosphorylation of RB1 leads to transcriptional activation of E2F1-3 target genes needed for the S phase of the cell cycle (Connell-Crowley et al. 1997). CDK2, in complex with cyclin E, contributes to RB1 inactivation and also activates proteins needed for the initiation of DNA replication (Zhang 2007). Expression of D type cyclins is regulated by extracellular mitogens (Cheng et al. 1998, Depoortere et al. 1998). Catalytic activities of CDK4/6 and CDK2 are controlled by CDK inhibitors of the INK4 family (Serrano et al. 1993, Hannon and Beach 1994, Guan et al. 1994, Guan et al. 1996, Parry et al. 1995) and the Cip/Kip family, respectively.

The cap is thought to influence splicing of the first intron, and is bound by 'cap-binding' proteins, CBP80 and CBP20, in the nucleus. The cap is important for translation initiation, and it also interacts with the poly(A)terminus, via proteins, resulting in circularization of the mRNA to facilitate multiple rounds of translation. The cap is also important for mRNA stability, protecting it from 5' to 3' nucleases, and is required for mRNA export to the cytoplasm.<BR>The capping reaction usually occurs very rapidly on nascent transcripts; after the synthesis of only a few nucleotides by RNA polymerase II. The capping reaction involves the conversion of the 5'-end of the nascent transcript from a triphosphate to a diphosphate by a RNA 5'-triphosphatase, followed by the addition of a guanosine monophosphate by the mRNA guanylyltransferase, to form a 5'-5'-triphosphate linkage.

Such editing events alter the coding properties of mRNA.<BR>RNA editing can be generally defined as the co- or post transcriptional modification of  the primary sequence of RNA from that encoded in the genome through nucleotide deletion, insertion, or base modification mechanisms.<BR>There are two pathways of RNA editing:  the substitution/conversion pathway and the insertion/deletion pathway. The  insertion/deletion editing occurs in protozoans like Trypanosoma, Leishmania; in slime molds like Physarum spp., and in some viral categories like paramyxoviruses, Ebola virus etc. To date, the substitution/conversion pathway has been observed in human along with other mammals, Drosophila, and some plants.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1865	Myogenesis		Myogenesis, the formation of muscle tissue, is a complex process involving steps of cell proliferation mediated by growth factor signaling, cell differentiation, reorganization of cells to form myotubes, and cell fusion. Here, one regulatory feature of this process has been annotated, the signaling cascade initiated by CDO (cell-adhesion-molecule-related/downregulated by oncogenes) and associated co-receptors.<p>CDO/Cdon is a type I transmembrane multifunctional co-receptor consisting of five immunoglobulin and three fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats in the extracellular domain, and an intracellular domain with no identifiable motifs. It has been implicated in enhancing muscle differentiation in promyogenic cells. CDO exert its promyogenic effects as a component of multiprotein complexes that include the closely related factor Boc, the Ig superfamily receptor neogenin and its ligand netrin-3, and the adhesion molecules N- and M-cadherin. CDO modulates the Cdc42 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways via a direct association with two scaffold-type proteins, JLP and Bnip-2, to regulate activities of myogenic bHLH factors and myogenic differentiation. CDO activates myogenic bHLH factors via enhanced heterodimer formation, most likely by inducing hyper-phosphorylation of E proteins. <br>Myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins are master regulatory proteins that activate the transcription of many muscle-specific genes during myogenesis. These myogenic bHLH proteins also referred to as MyoD family includes four members, MyoD, myogenin, myf5 and MRF4. These myogenic factors dimerize with E-proteins such as E12/E47, ITF-2 and HEB to form heterodimeric complexes that bind to a conserved DNA sequence known as the E box, which is present in the promoters and enhancers of most muscle-specific genes. Myocyte enhancer binding factor 2 (MEF2), which is a member of the MADS box family, also plays an important role in muscle differentiation. MEF2 activates transcription by binding to the consensus sequence, called the MEF2-binding site, which is also found in the control regions of numerous muscle-specific genes. MEF2 and myogenic bHLH proteins synergistically activate expression of muscle-specific genes via protein-protein interactions between DNA-binding domains of these heterologous classes of transcription factors. Members of the MyoD and MEF2 family of transcription factors associate combinatorially to control myoblast specification, differentiation and proliferation.

The role of NCAM in neural differentiation and synaptic plasticity is presumed to depend on the modulation of intracellular signal transduction cascades. NCAM based signaling complexes can initiate downstream intracellular signals by at least two mechanisms: (1) activation of FGFR and (2) formation of intracellular signaling complexes by direct interaction with cytoplasmic interaction partners such as Fyn and FAK. Tyrosine kinases Fyn and FAK interact with NCAM and undergo phosphorylation and this transiently activates the MAPK, ERK 1 and 2, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and transcription factors ELK and NFkB. CREB activates transcription of genes which are important for axonal growth, survival, and synaptic plasticity in neurons.<br><br>NCAM1 mediated intracellular signal transduction is represented in the figure below.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1867	Nephrin family interactions		Nephrin (NPHS1) is a member of the Super-IgG-Molecule family and is most prominently expressed in kidney podocytes. It is a major if not the most important structural component of the slit diaphragm, a modified adherens junction inbetween these cells. NPHS1 has an extracellular domain that contains eight distal IgG like domains and one proximal fibronectin type III domain, a transmembrane domain and a short intracellular domain. NPHS1 molecules show both homophilic and heterophilic interactions. Among heterophilic interaction partners, slit diaphragm proteins such as Kin of IRRE-like protein 1 (KIRREL, Nephrin-like protein 1, NEPH1),  KIRREL3 (NEPH2) and KIRREL2 (NEPH3) were shown to stabilize the slit diaphragm structure. Intracellularly Podocin (NPHS2), CD2 associated protein (CD2AP) and adherins junction associated proteins like IQGAP, MAGI, CASK and spectrins all interact with NPHS1. Hence it seems to play a major role in organizing the molecular structure of the slit diaphragm itself and via its binding partners links it to the actin cytoskeleton. NPHS1 tyrosine phosphorylation by the Src kinase FYN initiates the PI3K-AKT signaling cascade, which seems to promote antiapoptotic signals.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1877	Passive transport by Aquaporins		Aquaporins (AQP's) are six-pass transmembrane proteins that form channels in membranes. Each monomer contains a central channel formed in part by two asparagine-proline-alanine motifs (NPA boxes) that confer selectivity for water and/or solutes. The monomers assemble into tetramers. During passive transport by Aquaporins most aquaporins (i.e. AQP0/MIP, AQP1, AQP2, AQP3, AQP4, AQP5, AQP7, AQP8, AQP9, AQP10) transport water into and out of cells according to the osmotic gradient across the membrane. Four aquaporins (the aquaglyceroporins AQP3, AQP7,  AQP9,  AQP10) conduct glycerol, three aquaporins (AQP7, AQP9, AQP10) conduct urea, and one aquaporin (AQP6) conducts anions, especially nitrate. AQP8 also conducts ammonia in addition to water.<br>AQP11 and AQP12, classified as group III aquaporins, were identified as a result of the genome sequencing project and are characterized by having variations in the first NPA box when compared to more traditional aquaporins. Additionally, a conserved cysteine residue is present about 9 amino acids downstream from the second NPA box and this cysteine is considered indicative of group III aquaporins. Purified AQP11 incorporated into liposomes showed water transport. Knockout mice lacking AQP11 had fatal cyst formation in the proximal tubule of the kidney. Exogenously expressed AQP12 showed intracellular localization. AQP12 is expressed exclusively in pancreatic acinar cells.<br>Aquaporins are important in fluid and solute transport in various tissues. During Transport of glycerol from adipocytes to the liver by Aquaporins, glycerol generated by triglyceride hydrolysis is exported from adipocytes by AQP7 and is imported into liver cells via AQP9. AQP1 plays a role in forming cerebrospinal fluid and AQP1, AQP4, and AQP9 appear to be important in maintaining fluid balance in the brain. AQP0, AQP1, AQP3, AQP4, AQP8, AQP9, and AQP11 play roles in the physiology of the hepatobiliary tract.<br>In the kidney, water and solutes are passed out of the bloodstream and into the proximal tubule via the slit-like structure formed by nephrin in the glomerulus. Water is reabsorbed from the filtrate during its transit through the proximal tubule, the descending loop of Henle, the distal convoluted tubule, and the collecting duct. Aquaporin-1 (AQP1) in the proximal tubule and the descending thin limb of Henle is responsible for about 90% of reabsorption (as estimated from mouse knockouts of AQP1). AQP1 is located on both the apical and basolateral surface of epithelial cells and thus transports water through the epithelium and back into the bloodstream. In the collecting duct epithelial cells have AQP2 on their apical surfaces and AQP3 and AQP4 on their basolateral surfaces to transport water across the epithelium. Vasopressin regulates renal water homeostasis via Aquaporins by regulating the permeability of the epithelium through activation of a signaling cascade leading to the phosphorylation of AQP2 and its translocation from intracellular vesicles to the apical membrane of collecting duct cells.<br>Here, three views of aquaporin-mediated transport have been annotated: a generic view of transport mediated by the various families of aquaporins independent of tissue type (Passive transport by Aquaporins), a view of the role of specific aquaporins in maintenance of renal water balance (Vasopressin regulates renal water homeostasis via Aquaporins), and a view of the role of specific aquaporins in glycerol transport from adipocytes to the liver (Transport of glycerol from adipocytes to the liver by Aquaporins).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1883	Platelet adhesion to exposed collagen		Initiation of platelet adhesion is the first step in the formation of the platelet plug. Circulating platelets are arrested and subsequently activated by exposed collagen and vWF. It is not entirely clear which type of collagen is responsible for adhesion and activation; collagen types I and III are abundant in vascular epithelia but several other types incluing IV are present (Farndale 2006). Several collagen binding proteins are expressed on platelets, including integrin alpha2 beta1, GPVI, and GPIV. Integrin alpha2 beta1, known on leukocytes as VLA-2, is the major platelet collagen receptor (Kunicki et al. 1988). It requires Mg2+ to interact with collagen and may require initiation mediated by the activation of integrin alphaIIb beta3 (van de Walle 2007). Binding occurs via the alpha2 subunit I domain to a collagen motif with the sequence Gly-Phe-Hyp-Gly-Glu-Arg (Emsley 2000). Binding of collagen to alpha2 beta1 generates intracellular signals that contribute to platelet activation. These facilitate the engagement of the lower-affinity collagen receptor, GPVI (Keely 1996), the key receptor involved in collagen-induced platelet activation. The GPVI receptor is a complex of the GPVI protein with a dimer of Fc epsilon R1 gamma (FceRI gamma). The Src family kinases Fyn and Lyn constitutively associate with the GPVI:FceRIgamma complex in platelets and initiate platelet activation through phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in FceRI gamma, leading to binding and activation of the tyrosine kinase Syk. Downstream of Syk, a series of adapter molecules and effectors lead to platelet activation. vWF  protein is a polymeric structure of variable size. It is secreted in two directions, by the endothelium basolaterally and into the bloodstream. Shear-induced aggregation is achieved when vWF binds via its A1 domain to GPIb (part of GPIb-IX-V), and via its A3 domain mediating collagen binding to the subendothelium. The interaction between vWF and GPIb is regulated by shear force; an increase in the shear stress results in a corresponding increase in the affinity of vWF for GPIb.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1885	Platelet homeostasis		Under normal conditions the vascular endothelium supports vasodilation, inhibits platelet adhesion and activation, suppresses coagulation, enhances fibrin cleavage and is anti-inflammatory in character. Under acute vascular trauma, vasoconstrictor mechanisms predominate and the endothelium becomes prothrombotic, procoagulatory and proinflammatory in nature. This is achieved by a reduction of endothelial dilating agents: adenosine, NO and prostacyclin; and by the direct action of ADP, serotonin and thromboxane on vascular smooth muscle cells to elicit their contraction (Becker et al. 2000). Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) are primarily expressed in endothelial cells. Both are important regulators of vascular function.

PGI2 and NO both oppose platelet activation and aggregation, as does the CD39 ecto-ADPase, which decreases platelet activation and recruitment by metabolizing platelet-released ADP.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1887	Post-translational modification: synthesis of GPI-anchored proteins		Glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI) acts as a membrane anchor for many cell surface proteins. GPI is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum. In humans, a single pathway consisting of eleven reactions appears to be responsible for the synthesis of the major GPI species involved in membrane protein anchoring.<p>As a nascent protein fated to become GPI-anchored moves into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, it is attacked by a transamidase complex that cleaves it near its carboxy terminus and attaches an acylated GPI moiety. The GPI moiety is deacylated, yielding a protein-GPI conjugate that can be efficiently transported to the Golgi apparatus.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1889	Processing of Capped Intron-Containing Pre-mRNA		Co-transcriptional pre-mRNA splicing is not obligatory. Pre-mRNA splicing begins co-transcriptionally and often continues post-transcriptionally. Human genes contain an average of nine introns per gene, which cannot serve as splicing substrates until both 5' and 3' ends of each intron are synthesized. Thus the time that it takes for pol II to synthesize each intron defines a minimal time and distance along the gene in which splicing factors can be recruited. The time that it takes for pol II to reach the end of the gene defines the maximal time in which splicing could occur co-transcriptionally. Thus, the kinetics of transcription can affect the kinetics of splicing.Any covalent change in a primary (nascent) mRNA transcript is mRNA Processing.  For successful gene expression, the primary mRNA transcript needs to be converted to a mature mRNA prior to its translation into polypeptide.  Eucaryotic mRNAs undergo a series of complex processing reactions; these begin on nascent transcripts as soon as a few ribonucleotides have been synthesized during transcription by RNA Polymerase II, through the export of the mature mRNA to the cytoplasm, and culminate with mRNA turnover in the cytoplasm.

Chaperones that take part broadly in de novo protein folding, such as the Hsp70s and the chaperonins, facilitate the folding process through cycles of substrate binding and release regulated by their  ATPase activity (see Young  et al., 2004; Spiess et al., 2004; Bigotti and Clarke, 2008).

Movement of Rap1 from endosomal membranes to the plasma membrane upon activation has been reported in several cell types including Jurkat T cells and megakaryocytes.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1903	Response to elevated platelet cytosolic Ca ions		Activation of phospholipase C enzymes results in the generation of second messengers of the phosphatidylinositol pathway. The events resulting from this pathway are a rise in intracellular calcium and activation of Protein Kinase C (PKC). Phospholipase C cleaves the phosphodiester bond in PIP2 to form 1,2 Diacylglycerol (DAG) and 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 opens Ca2+ channels in the platelet dense tubular system, raising intracellular Ca2+ levels. DAG is a second messenger that regulates a family of Ser/Thr kinases consisting of PKC isozymes (Nishizuka 1995). DAG achieves activation of PKC isozymes by increasing their affinity for phospholipid. Most PKC enzymes are also calcium-dependent, so their activation is in synergy with the rise in intracellular Ca2+. Platelets contain several PKC isoforms that can be activated by DAG and/or Ca2+ (Chang 1997). View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=76005 Reactome].		9606

Functionally RIG-I and MDA5 positively regulate the IFN genes in a similar fashion, however they differ in their response to different viral species. RIG-I is essential for detecting influenza virus, Sendai virus, VSV and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), whereas MDA5 is essential in sensing encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), Mengo virus and Theiler's virus, all of which belong to the picornavirus family. RIG-I and MDA5 signalling results in the activation of IKK epsilon and (TKK binding kinase 1) TBK1, two serine/threonine kinases that phosphorylate interferon regulatory factor 3 and 7 (IRF3 and IRF7). Upon phosphorylation, IRF3 and IRF7 translocate to the nucleus and subsequently induce interferon alpha (IFNA) and interferon beta (IFNB) gene transcription.

Pol II consists of a 10-subunit catalytic core, which alone is capable of elongating the RNA transcript, and a complex of two subunits, Rpb4/7, that is required for transcription initiation. <BR>  The transcription cycle is divided in three major phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. Transcription initiation include promoter DNA binding, DNA melting, and initial synthesis of short RNA transcripts. The transition from initiation to elongation, is referred to as promoter escape and leads to a stable elongation complex that is characterized by an open DNA region or transcription bubble. The bubble contains the DNA-RNA hybrid, a heteroduplex of eight to nine base pairs. The growing 3-end of the RNA is engaged with the polymerase complex active site.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1908	Signal amplification		In the initial response to injury, platelets adhere to damaged blood vessels, responding to the exposure of collagen from the vascular epithelium. Once adhered they degranulate, releasing stored secondary agents such as ADP and ATP, and synthesized thromboxane A2. These amplify the response, activating and recruiting further platelets to the area and promoting platelet aggregation. Adenosine nucleotides secreted following platelet activation signal through P2 purinergic receptors on the platelet membrane. ADP activates P2Y1 and P2Y12 while ATP activates the ionotropic P2X1 receptor (Kunapuli et al. 2003). Activation of these receptors initiates a complex signaling cascade that ultimately results in platelet activation and thrombus formation (Kahner et al. 2006). ADP stimulation of P2Y1 and P2Y12 involves signaling via both the alpha and gamma:beta components of the heterotrimeric G-protein (Hirsch et al. 2001, 2006).

CD47, a widely expressed transmembrane protein, is a ligand for SIRP alpha, with the two proteins constituting a cell-cell communication system. The interaction of SIRPA with CD47 is important for the regulation of migration and phagocytosis. SIRPA functions as a docking protein to recruit and activate PTPN6 (SHP-1) or PTPN11 (SHP-2) at the cell membrane in response to extracellular stimuli. SIRPA also binds other intracellular proteins including the adaptor molecules Src kinase-associated protein (SKAP2 SKAP55hom/R), Fyn-binding protein/SLP-76-associated phosphoprotein (FYB/SLAP-130) and the tyrosine kinase PYK2. SIRPA also binds the extracellular proteins, surfactant-A (SP-A) and surfactant-D (SP-D). <br>The SIRP family members SIRPB and SIRPG show high sequence similarity and similar extracellular structural topology, including three Ig domains, but their ligand binding topology might differ.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1910	Signaling by EGFR		The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is one member of the ERBB family of transmembrane glycoprotein tyrosine receptor kinases (RTK). Binding of EGFR to its ligands induces conformational change that unmasks the dimerization interface in the extracellular domain of EGFR, leading to receptor homo- or heterodimerization at the cell surface. Dimerization of the extracellular regions of EGFR triggers additional conformational change of the cytoplasmic EGFR regions, enabling the kinase domains of two EGFR molecules to achieve the catalytically active conformation. Ligand activated EGFR dimers trans-autophosphorylate on tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor. Phosphorylated tyrosines serve as binding sites for the recruitment of signal transducers and activators of intracellular substrates, which then stimulate intracellular signal transduction cascades that are involved in regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Recruitment of complexes containing GRB2 and SOS1 to phosphorylated EGFR dimers either directly, through phosphotyrosine residues that serve as GRB2 docking sites, or indirectly, through SHC1 recruitment, promotes GDP to GTP exchange on RAS, resulting in the activation of RAF/MAP kinase cascade. Binding of complexes of GRB2 and GAB1 to phosphorylated EGFR dimers leads to formation of the active PI3K complex, conversion of PIP2 into PIP3, and activation of AKT signaling. Phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLCG1) can also be recruited directly, through EGFR phosphotyrosine residues that serve as PLCG1 docking sites, which leads to PLCG1 phosphorylation by EGFR and activation of DAG and IP3 signaling. EGFR signaling is downregulated by the action of ubiquitin ligase CBL. CBL binds directly to the phosphorylated EGFR dimer through the phosphotyrosine Y1045 in the C-tail of EGFR, and after CBL is phosphorylated by EGFR, it becomes active and ubiquitinates phosphorylated EGFR dimers, targeting them for degradation.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1913	Signaling by insulin receptor		Insulin binding to its receptor results in receptor autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues and the tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates (e.g. IRS and Shc) by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase.  This allows association of IRSs with downstream effectors such as PI-3K via its Src homology 2 (SH2) domains leading to end point events such as Glut4 (Slc2a4) translocation.  Shc when tyrosine phosphorylated associates with Grb2 and can thus activate the Ras/MAPK pathway independent of the IRSs.<p>Signal transduction by the insulin receptor is not limited to its activation at the cell surface.  The activated ligand-receptor complex initially at the cell surface, is internalised into endosomes itself a process which is dependent on tyrosine autophosphorylation.  Endocytosis of activated receptors has the dual effect of concentrating receptors within endosomes and allows the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase to phosphorylate substrates that are spatially distinct from those accessible at the plasma membrane.  Acidification of the endosomal lumen, due to the presence of proton pumps, results in dissociation of insulin from its receptor.  (The endosome constitutes the major site of insulin degradation).   This loss of the ligand-receptor complex attenuates any further insulin-driven receptor re-phosphorylation events and leads to receptor dephosphorylation by extra-lumenal endosomally-associated protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). The identity of these PTPs is not clearly established yet. View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=74752 Reactome].		9606

The classical PDGF chains, PDGF-A and PDGF-B, and more recently discovered PDGF-C and PDGF-D. The four PDGF chains assemble into disulphide-bonded dimers via homo- or heterodimerization, and five different dimeric isoforms have been described so far; PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, PDGF-CC and PDGF-DD. It is notable that no heterodimers involving PDGF-C and PDGF-D chains have been described. PDGF exerts its effects by binding to, and activating, two protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) receptors, alpha and beta. These receptors dimerize and undergo autophosphorylation.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1917	Signaling by Rho GTPases		The Rho family of small guanine nucleotide binding proteins is one of five generally recognized branches of the Ras superfamily. Like most Ras superfamily members, typical Rho proteins function as binary switches controlling a variety of biological processes. They perform this function by cycling between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound conformations. Mammalian Rho GTPases include RhoA, RhoB and RhoC (Rho proteins), Rac1 3 (Rac proteins), Cdc42, TC10, TCL, Wrch1, Chp/Wrch2, RhoD and RhoG, to name some. The family also includes RhoH and Rnd1-3, which lack GTPase activity and are predicted to exist in a constitutively active state.<p>Members of the Rho family have been identified in all eukaryotes. Including the atypical RHOBTB1-3 and RHOT1-2 proteins, 24 Rho family members have been identified in mammals (Jaffe and Hall, 2005; Bernards, 2005; Ridley, 2006). Among Rho GTPases, RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 have been most extensively studied. These proteins are best known for their ability to induce dynamic rearrangements of the plasma membrane-associated actin cytoskeleton (Aspenstrom et al, 2004; Murphy et al, 1999; Govek et al, 2005). Beyond this function, Rho GTPases also regulate actomyosin contractility and microtubule dynamics. Rho mediated effects on transcription and membrane trafficking are believed to be secondary to these functions. At the more macroscopic level, Rho GTPases have been implicated in many important cell biological processes, including cell growth control, cytokinesis, cell motility, cell cell and cell extracellular matrix adhesion, cell transformation and invasion, and development (Govek et al., 2005).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1918	Signaling by ROBO receptors		The Roundabout (ROBO) family encodes transmembrane receptors that regulate axonal guidance and cell migration. The major function of the Robo receptors is to mediate repulsion of the navigating growth cones. There are four human Robo homologues, ROBO1, ROBO2, ROBO3 and ROBO4. Most of the ROBOs have the similar ectodomain architecture as the cell adhesion molecules, with five Ig domains followed by three FN3 repeats, except for ROBO4. ROBO4 has two Ig and two FN3 repeats. The cytoplasmic domains of ROBO receptors are in general poorly conserved. However, there are four short conserved cytoplasmic sequence motifs, named CC0-3, that serve as binding sites for adaptor proteins. The ligands for the human ROBO1 and ROBO2 receptors are the three SLIT proteins SLIT1, SLIT2, and SLIT3; all of the SLIT proteins contain a tandem of four LRR (leucine rich repeat) domains at the N-terminus, termed D1-D4, followed by six EGF (epidermal growth factor)-like domains, a laminin G like domain (ALPS), three EGF-like domains, and a C-terminal cysteine knot domain. Most SLIT proteins are cleaved within the EGF-like region by unknown proteases (reviewed by Hohenster 2008, Ypsilanti and Chedotal 2014, Blockus and Chedotal 2016). NELL2 is a ligand for ROBO3 (Jaworski et al. 2015).<br><br>SLIT protein binding modulates ROBO interactions with the cytosolic adaptors. The cytoplasmic domain of ROBO1 and ROBO2 determines the repulsive responses of these receptors. Based on the studies from both invertebrate and vertebrate organisms it has been inferred that ROBO induces growth cone repulsion by controlling cytoskeletal dynamics via either Abelson kinase (ABL) and Enabled (Ena), or RAC1 activity (reviewed by Hohenster 2008, Ypsilanti and Chedotal 2014, Blockus and Chedotal 2016). While there is some redundancy in the function of ROBO receptors, ROBO1 is implicated as the predominant receptor for axon guidance in ventral tracts, and ROBO2 is the predominant receptor for axon guidance in dorsal tracts. ROBO2 also repels neuron cell bodies from the floor plate (Kim et al. 2011).<p>In addition to regulating axon guidance, ROBO1 and ROBO2 receptors are also implicated in regulation of proliferation and transition of primary to intermediate neuronal progenitors through a poorly characterized cross-talk with NOTCH-mediated activation of HES1 transcription (Borrell et al. 2012).<p>Thalamocortical axon extension is regulated by neuronal activity-dependent transcriptional regulation of ROBO1 transcription. Lower neuronal activity correlates with increased ROBO1 transcription, possibly mediated by the NFKB complex (Mire et al. 2012).<p>It is suggested that the homeodomain transcription factor NKX2.9 stimulates transcription of ROBO2, which is involved in regulation of motor axon exit from the vertebrate spinal code (Bravo-Ambrosio et al. 2012).<p>Of the four ROBO proteins, ROBO4 is not involved in neuronal system development but is, instead, involved in angiogenesis. The interaction of ROBO4 with SLIT3 is involved in proliferation, motility and chemotaxis of endothelial cells, and accelerates formation of blood vessels (Zhang et al. 2009).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1919	Signaling by VEGF		In normal development vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) are crucial regulators of vascular development during embryogenesis (vasculogenesis) and blood-vessel formation in the adult (angiogenesis). In tumor progression, activation of VEGF pathways promotes tumor vascularization, facilitating tumor growth and metastasis. Abnormal VEGF function is also associated with inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis, and hyperthyroidism. The members of the VEGF and VEGF-receptor protein families have distinct but overlapping ligand-receptor specificities, cell-type expression, and function. VEGF-receptor activation in turn regulates a network of signaling processes in the body that promote endothelial cell growth, migration and survival (Hicklin and Ellis, 2005; Shibuya and Claesson-Welsh, 2006).<br>Molecular features of the VGF signaling cascades are outlined in the figure below (from Olsson et al. 2006; Nature Publishing Group).

Members of the Src kinases (Lck), Syk kinases (ZAP-70), Tec (Itk) and Csk families of nonreceptor PTKs play a crucial role in T cell activation. Activation of PTKs following TCR engagement results in the recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of enzymes such as phospholipase C gamma1 and Vav as well as critical adaptor proteins such as LAT, SLP-76 and Gads. These proximal activation leads to reorganization of the cytoskeleton as well as transcription activation of multiple genes leading to T lymphocyte proliferation, differentiation and/or effector function.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1928	Telomere Maintenance		"Telomeres are protein-DNA complexes at the ends of linear chromosomes that are important for genome stability. Telomeric DNA in humans, as in many eukaryotic organisms, consists of tandem repeats (Blackburn and Gall 1978; Moyzis et al. 1988; Meyne et al. 1989). The repeats at human telomeres are composed of TTAGGG sequences and stretch for several kilobase pairs. Another feature of telomeric DNA in many eukaryotes is a G-rich 3' single strand overhang, which in humans is estimated to be approximately 50-300 bases long (Makarov et al. 1997; Wright et al. 1997; Huffman et al. 2000). Telomeric DNA isolated from humans and several other organisms can form a lasso-type structure called a t-loop in which the 3' single-strand end is presumed to invade the double stranded telomeric DNA repeat tract (Griffith et al. 1999). Telomeric DNA is bound by multiple protein factors that play important roles in regulating telomere length and in protecting the chromosome end from recombination, non-homologous end-joining, DNA damage signaling, and unregulated nucleolytic attack (reviewed in de Lange 2005).<br><br>DNA attrition can occur at telomeres, which can impact cell viability. Attrition can occur owing to the ""end-replication problem"", a consequence of the mechanism of lagging-strand synthesis (Watson 1972; Olovnikov 1973). Besides incomplete replication, nucleolytic processing also likely contributes to telomere attrition (Huffman et al. 2000). If telomeres become critically shortened, replicative senescence can result (Harley et al. 1990). Thus, in order to undergo multiple divisions, cells need a mechanism to replenish the sequence at their chromosome ends.<br><br>The primary means for maintaining the sequence at chromosome ends in many eukaryotic organisms, including humans, is based on telomerase (Greider and Blackburn, 1985; Morin 1989). Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex minimally composed of a conserved protein subunit containing a reverse transcriptase domain (telomerase reverse transcriptase, TERT) (Lingner et al. 1997; Nakamura et al. 1997) and a template-containing RNA (telomerase RNA component, TERC, TR, TER) (Greider and Blackburn, 1987; Feng et al 1995). Telomerase uses the RNA template to direct addition of multiple tandem repeats to the 3' G-rich single strand overhang. Besides extension by telomerase, maintenance of telomeric DNA involves additional activities, including C-strand synthesis, which fills in the opposing strand, and nucleolytic processing, which likely contributes to the generation of the 3' overhang.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1929	Thrombin signaling through proteinase activated receptors (PARs)		Thrombin activates proteinase activated receptors (PARs) that signal through heterotrimeric G proteins of the G12/13 and Gq families, thereby connecting to a host of intracellular signaling pathways. Thrombin activates PARs by cleaving an N-terminal peptide that then binds to the body of the receptor to effect transmembrane signaling. Intermolecular ligation of one PAR molecule by another can occur but is less efficient than self-ligation. A synthetic peptide of sequence SFLLRN, the first six amino acids of the new N-terminus generated when thrombin cleaves PAR1, can activate PAR1 independent of protease and receptor cleavage. PARs are key to platelet activation. Four PARs have been identified, of which PARs 1 ,3 and 4 are substrates for thrombin. In humans PAR 1 is the predominant thrombin receptor followed by PAR4 which is less responsive to thrombin. PAR 3 is not considered important for human platelet responses as it is minimally expressed, though this is not the case for mouse. PAR2 is not expressed in platelets. In mouse platelets, Gq is necessary for platelet secretion and aggregation in response to thrombin but is not necessary for thrombin-triggered shape change. G13 appears to contribute to platelet aggregation as well as shape change in response to low concentrations of thrombin but to be unnecessary at higher agonist concentrations; G12 appears to be dispensable for thrombin signaling in platelets. G alpha (q) activates phospholipase C beta thereby triggering phosphoinositide hydrolysis, calcium mobilization and protein kinase C activation. This provides a path to calcium-regulated kinases and phosphatases, GEFs, MAP kinase cassettes and other proteins that mediate cellular responses ranging from granule secretion, integrin activation, and aggregation in platelets. Gbeta:gamma subunits can activate phosphoinositide-3 kinase and other lipid modifying enzymes, protein kinases, and channels. PAR1 activation indirectly leads to activation of cell surface 'sheddases' that liberate ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases, providing a link between thrombin and receptor tyrosine kinases involved in cell growth and differentiation. The pleiotrophic effects of PAR activation are consistent with many of thrombin's diverse actions on cells.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1934	Transmission across Electrical Synapses 		Electrical transmission across nerve cells is accomplished when the current generated in the upstream neuron spreads to the downstream neuron through a path of low electrical resistance. In neurons this is accomplished at gap junctions. Electrical synapses are found in neuronal tissue where the activity of neurons must be highly synchronized. The neurons responsible for hormone secretion from the mammalian hypothalamus are a class of highly synchronized electric neurons.  Gap junctions connecting the presynaptic cell with the postsynaptic cell allow current generated in the presynaptic cell to flow directly into the postsynaptic cell. Transmission speed is dramatically increased in such a system. The junction itself is composed of two hemichannels, one each on the pre- and postsysnaptic cells. These channels are composed of members of the connexin family of proteins. View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=112307 Reactome].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1935	Transport of bile salts and organic acids, metal ions and amine compounds		SLC transporters described in this section transport bile salts, organic acids, metal ions and amine compounds.<br>Myo-Inositol is a neutral cyclic polyol, abundant in mammalian tissues. It is a precursor to phosphatidylinositols (PtdIns) and to the inositol phosphates (IP), which serve as second messengers and also act as key regulators of many cell functions. Three members of the glucose transporter gene family encode inositol transporters (SLC2A13, SLC5A3 and SLC5A11) (Schneider 2015).<br>Five human SLC13 genes encode sodium-coupled sulphate, di- and tri-carboxylate transporters typically located on the plasma membrane of mammalian cells (Pajor 2006).<br>The SLC16A gene family encode proton-linked monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) which mediate the transport of monocarboxylates such as lactate and pyruvate, major energy sources for all cells in the body so their transport in and out of cells is crucial for cellular function (Morris & Felmlee 2008).<br>The transport of essential metals and other nutrients across tight membrane barriers such as the gastrointestinal tract and blood-brain barrier is mediated by metal-transporting proteins (encoded by SLC11, SLC30, SLC31, SLC39, SLC40 and SLC41). They can also regulate metals by efflux out of cells and cellular compartments to avoid toxic build-up (Bressler et al. 2007).<br>The SLC6 gene family encodes proteins that mediate neurotransmitter uptake in the central nervous system (CSN) and peripheral nervous system (PNS), thus terminating a synaptic signal. The proteins mediate transport of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, glycine, taurine, L-proline, creatine and betaine (Chen et al. 2004).<br>Carrier-mediated urea transport allows rapid urea movement across the cell membrane, which is particularly important in the process of urinary concentration and for rapid urea equilibrium in non-renal tissues. Two carriers exist in humans, encoded by SLC14A1 and ALC14A2 (Olives et al. 1994).<br>Choline uptake is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. SLC genes SLC5A7 and the SLC44 family encode choline transporters ((Okuda & Haga 2000, Traiffort et al. 2005).<br>The SLC22 gene family of solute carriers function as organic cation transporters (OCTs), cation/zwitterion transporters (OCTNs) and organic anion transporters (OATs). Most of this family are polyspecific transporters. Since many of these transporters are expressed in the liver, kidney and intestine, they play an important role in drug absorption and excretion. Substrates include xenobiotics, drugs, and endogenous amine compounds (Koepsell & Endou 2004). View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=425366 Reactome].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1936	Transport of inorganic cations/anions and amino acids/oligopeptides		Teleologically, one might argue that inorganic cation and anion transport would be evolutionarily among the oldest transport functions. Eight families comprise the group that transports exclusively inorganic cations and anions across membranes : SLC4 plays a pivotal role in mediating Na+ - and/or Cl- -dependent transport of basic anions [e.g. HCO3-, (CO3)2-] in various tissues and cell types (in addition to pH regulation, specific members of this family also contribute to vectorial trans-epithelial base transport in several organ systems including the kidney, pancreas, and eye) (Pushkin A and Kurtz I, 2006);  SLC8 is a group of Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (SLC8A1 is involved in cardiac contractility) (Quednau BD et al, 2004); SLC24 is a group of Na+/Ca2+ or Na+/K+ exchangers (Altimimi HF and Schnetkamp PP, 2007); SLC9 comprises Na+/H+ exchanger proteins involved in the electroneutral exchange of sodium ion and protons (Orlowski J and Grinstein S, 2004); SLC12 functions as Na+, K+ and Cl- ion electroneutral symporters (Hebert SC et al, 2004); SLC26 is the trans-epithelial multifunctional anion (e.g. sulfate, oxalate, HCO-, Cl-) exchanger family, important in cartilage development, production of thyroid hormone, sound amplification in the cochlea etc (Sindic A et al, 2007; Dorwart MR et al, 2008; Ashmore J, 2008). SLC34 is an important Type II Na+/(HPO4)2- symporter (Forster IC et al, 2006; Virkki LV et al, 2007); SLC20 was originally identified as a viral receptor, and functions as a Type III Na+/(H2PO4)- symporter (Collins JF et al, 2004; Virkki LV et al, 2007).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1937	Transport of vitamins, nucleosides, and related molecules		This section groups the processes mediated by SLC transporters, by which vitamins and cofactors, as well as nucleosides, nucleotides, nucleobases, and related molecules cross lipid bilayer membranes (He et al. 2009).<br>The human SLC5A6 encodes the Na+-dependent multivitamin transporter SMVT (Prasad et al. 1999). SMVT co-transports biotin (vitamin B7), D-Pantothoate (vitamin B5) and lipoic acid into cells with Na+ ions electrogenically.<br>Four SLC gene families encode transporters that mediate the movement of nucleosides and free purine and pyrimidine bases across the plasma membrane. These transporters play key roles in nucleoside and nucleobase uptake for salvage pathways of nucleotide synthesis, and in the cellular uptake of nucleoside analogues used in the treatment of cancers and viral diseases (He et al. 2009).<br>The human gene SLC33A1 encodes acetyl-CoA transporter AT1 (Kanamori et al. 1997). Acetyl-CoA is transported to the lumen of the Golgi apparatus, where it serves as the substrate of acetyltransferases that O-acetylates sialyl residues of gangliosides and glycoproteins.<br>Nucleotide sugars are used as sugar donors by glycosyltransferases to create the sugar chains for glycoconjugates such as glycoproteins, polysaccharides and glycolipids. Glycosyltransferases reside mainly in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) whereas nucleotide sugars are synthesized in the cytosol. The human solute carrier family SLC35 encode nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs), localised on Golgi and ER membranes, which can mediate the antiport of nucleotide sugars in exchange for the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates (eg. UMP for UDP-sugars) (Handford et al. 2006).<br>Long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) can be used for energy sources and steroid hormone synthesis and regulate many cellular processes such as inflammation, blood pressure, the clotting process, blood lipid levels and the immune response. The SLC27A family encode fatty acid transporter proteins (FATPs) (Stahl 2004).<br>The SLC gene family members SLCO1 SLCO2 and SLCO3 encode organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs). OATPs are membrane transport proteins that mediate the sodium-independent transport of a wide range of amphipathic organic compounds including bile salts, steroid conjugates, thyroid hormones, anionic oligopeptides and numerous drugs (Hagenbuch & Meier 2004).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1938	tRNA aminoacylation		tRNA synthetases catalyze the ligation of tRNAs to their cognate amino acids in an ATP-dependent manner. The reaction proceeds in two steps. First, amino acid and ATP form an aminoacyl adenylate molecule, releasing pyrophosphate. The aminoacyl adenylate remains associated with the synthetase enzyme where, in the second step it reacts with tRNA to form aminoacyl tRNA and AMP. The rapid hydrolysis of pyrophosphate makes these reactions essentially irreversible under physiological conditions (Fersht and Kaethner 1976a). Specificity of the tRNA charging reactions is achieved both by specific recognition of amino acid and tRNA substrates by the synthetase, and by an editing process in which incorrect aminoacyl adenylate molecules (e.g., valyl adenylate associated with isoleucyl tRNA synthetase) are hydrolyzed rather than conjugated to tRNAs in the second step of the reaction (Baldwin and Berg 1966a,b; Fersht and Kaethner 1976b). The tRNA synthetases can be divided into two structural classes based on conserved amino acid sequence features (Burnbaum and Schimmel 1991).<p>A single synthetase mediates the charging of all of the tRNA species specific for any one amino acid but, with three exceptions, glycine, lysine, and glutamine, the synthetase that catalyzes aminoacylation of mitochondrial tRNAs is encoded by a different gene than the one that acts on mitochondrial tRNAs. Both mitochondrial and cytosolic tRNA synthetase enzymes are encoded by genes in the nuclear genome.<p>A number of tRNA synthetases are known to have functions distinct from tRNA charging (reviewed by Park et al. 2005). Additionally, mutations in several of the tRNA synthetases, often affecting protein domains that are dispensable in vitro for aminoacyl tRNA synthesis, are associated with a diverse array of neurological and other diseases (Antonellis and Green 2008; Park et al. 2008). These findings raise interest into the role of these enzymes in human development and disease.<p> View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=379724 Reactome].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1939	Unfolded Protein Response		The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) is a regulatory system that protects the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) from overload. The UPR is provoked by the accumulation of improperly folded protein in the ER during times of unusually high secretion activity. Analysis of mutants with altered UPR, however, shows that the UPR is also required for normal development and function of secretory cells.<br>One level at which the URP operates is transcriptional and translational regulation: mobilization of ATF6, ATF6B, CREB3 factors and IRE1 leads to increased transcription of genes encoding chaperones, while mobilization of PERK (pancreatic eIF2alpha kinase, EIF2AK3) leads to phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha and global down-regulation of protein synthesis.<br>ATF6, ATF6B, and CREB3 factors (CREB3 (LUMAN), CREB3L1 (OASIS), CREB3L2 (BBF2H7, Tisp40), CREB3L3 (CREB-H), and CREB3L4 (CREB4)) are membrane-bound transcription activators that respond to ER stress by transiting from the ER membrane to the Golgi membrane where their transmembrane domains are cleaved, releasing their cytosolic domains to transit to the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes. IRE1, also a resident of the ER membrane, dimerizes and autophosphorylates in response to ER stress. The activated IRE1 then catalyzes unconventional splicing of XBP1 mRNA to yield an XBP1 isoform that is targeted to the nucleus and activates chaperone genes.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1946	Cori cycle		The Cori cycle (also known as the Lactic acid cycle), named after its discoverers, Carl Ferdinand Cori and Gerty Cori, refers to the metabolic pathway in which lactate produced by anaerobic glycolysis in the muscles moves to the liver and is converted to glucose, which then returns to the muscles and is metabolized back to lactate.Muscular activity requires ATP, which is provided by the breakdown of glycogen in the skeletal muscles. The breakdown of glycogen, a process known as glycogenolysis, releases glucose in the form of glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P). The G-1-P is converted to G-6-P by the enzyme phosphoglucomutase. G-6-P is readily fed into glycolysis, (or can go into the pentose phosphate pathway if G-6-P concentration is high) a process that provides ATP to the muscle cells as an energy source. During muscular activity, the store of ATP needs to be constantly replenished. When the supply of oxygen is sufficient, this energy comes from feeding pyruvate, one product of glycolysis, into the Krebs cycle. When oxygen supply is insufficient, typically during intense muscular activity, energy must be released through anaerobic metabolism. Lactic acid fermentation converts pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase. Most importantly, fermentation regenerates NAD+, maintaining the NAD+ concentration so that additional glycolysis reactions can occur. The fermentation step oxidizes the NADH produced by glycolysis back to NAD+, transferring two electrons from NADH to reduce pyruvate into lactate. Instead of accumulating inside the muscle cells, lactate produced by anaerobic fermentation is taken up by the liver. This initiates the other half of the Cori cycle. In the liver, gluconeogenesis occurs. From an intuitive perspective, gluconeogenesis reverses both glycolysis and fermentation by converting lactate first into pyruvate, and finally back to glucose. The glucose is then supplied to the muscles through the bloodstream; it is ready to be fed into further glycolysis reactions. If muscle activity has stopped, the glucose is used to replenish the supplies of glycogen through glycogenesis.Overall, the glycolysis part of the cycle produces 2 ATP molecules at a cost of 6 ATP molecules consumed in the gluconeogenesis part. Each iteration of the cycle must be maintained by a net consumption of 4 ATP molecules. As a result, the cycle cannot be sustained indefinitely. The intensive consumption of ATP molecules indicates that the Cori cycle shifts the metabolic burden from the muscles to the liver.Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cori_cycle Wikipedia]Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1946 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP195	IL-1 signaling pathway		The IL-1 family of cytokines currently consists of 11 members which are encoded by distinct genes and includes IL-1Î±, IL-1Î², and the IL-1 Receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). The major role of IL-1 type cytokines is to control pro-inflammatory reactions in response to tissue injury - either due to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or Danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Interleukin-1 (IL-1), which includes IL-1Î± and IL-1Î², plays a crucial role in many auto inflammatory diseases. IL- 1Î± and IL-1Î² are produced predominantly by macrophages and monocytes, and to a lesser extent by other cell types such as epithelial cells endothelial cells and fibroblasts. IL-1 alpha, is a membrane anchored protein which signals through autocrine or juxtracrine mechanisms where as the soluble IL-1Î² acts in a paracrine or systemic manner. Significant progress has been achieved in the study of the signaling events mediated by IL-1 and the processes they control. Involvement of IL-1Î± or IL-1Î² in host responses to infections caused by intracellular microorganisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as in autoinflammatory diseases makes its signaling components important candidates for drug targetting for these diseases. The two forms of IL-1 (IL-1Î± and IL-1Î²) bind to the same cellular receptor, the Type I IL- 1 receptor (IL-1RI) to induce signaling. Upon receptor engagement, IL-1R1 forms a heterodimer with IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), which functions as a co receptor. IL-1RAcP cannot bind directly to IL-1 but is essential for IL-1-mediated signaling. Binding of IL-1 to this receptor complex leads to the activation of the transcription factor NF-ÎºB through different signaling mechanisms. Two IL-1 receptor-associated kinases, IRAK-1 and IRAK-2 have been implicated in the activation of NF-ÎºB. IRAK 1 and 2 functions as adapter proteins and protein kinases to transmit downstream signals. It recruits TRAF6 to the IL-1 receptor complex via an interaction with IL-1RAcP. Oligomerization of TRAF6 and subsequent formation of TAK1 and MEKK3 signaling complexes relays the signal via NF-ÎºB-inducing kinase (NIK) to two I-kappaB kinases (IKK-1 and -2), leading to NF-kappaB activation. Activation of other mitogen activated protein kinases, including JNKs and p38 MAPK through various MAP2Ks also play important roles in mediating IL-1 responses by activating transcription through the AP-1 transcription factor. The above mentioned signaling events co-operatively induce the expression of IL-1 target genes such as CCL2, IL-8 and IL-6. The interactions and intersections between canonical and non-canonical Interleukin-1 signaling systems are depicted in the pathway map. Regulation of IL-1 signaling can be brought about by various mechanisms. The IL-1 family member IL-1RA can bind to the IL1-R1 receptor with similar affinity as IL-1Î± and Î², but is incapable of activating the signaling response. The type II IL-1 receptor can bind to IL-1 alpha and beta but lacks signaling capacity. The naturally occurring 'shed' domains of the extracellular IL-1 receptor chains (IL-1RI, IL-1RII and IL- 1RAcP) also act as inhibitors of IL-1 signaling. In the cell, IL-1R binds to toll- interacting protein (TOLLIP), which results in the inhibition of IRAK1 and by promoting efficient degradation of IL-1R by targeting the internalized receptor to endosomes. Other mechanisms such as p38MAPK mediated phosphorylation of TAB1 which results in the inactivation of TAK1, and expression of genes including MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) and Inhibitor of kappa B alpha (NFKBIA) that inhibit IL-1 signaling components also serve as negative regulators of IL-1 signaling.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_1_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

Opioids possess powerful analgesic and sedative effects, and are widely used as pain-killers. Their main side-effect is the rapid establishment of a strong addiction.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1980	Nucleotide Excision Repair		Nucleotide excision repair (NER) was first described in the model organism E. coli in the early 1960s as a process whereby bulky base damage is enzymatically removed from DNA, facilitating the recovery of DNA synthesis and cell survival. Deficient NER processes have been identified from the cells of cancer-prone patients with different variants of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), trichothiodystrophy (TTD), and Cockayne's syndrome. The XP cells exhibit an ultraviolet radiation hypersensitivity that leads to a hypermutability response to UV, offering a direct connection between deficient NER, increased mutation rate, and cancer. While the NER pathway in prokaryotes is unique, the pathway utilized in yeast and higher eukaryotes is highly conserved.<BR>NER is involved in the repair of bulky adducts in DNA, such as UV-induced photo lesions (both 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PPDs) and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs)), as well as chemical adducts formed from exposure to aflatoxin, benzopyrene and other genotoxic agents. Specific proteins have been identified that participate in base damage recognition, cleavage of the damaged strand on both sides of the lesion, and excision of the oligonucleotide bearing the lesion. Reparative DNA synthesis and ligation restore the strand to its original state.<BR>NER consists of two related pathways called global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). The pathways differ in the way in which DNA damage is initially recognized, but the majority of the participating molecules are shared between these two branches of NER. GG-NER is transcription-independent, removing lesions from non-coding DNA strands, as well as coding DNA strands that are not being actively transcribed. TC-NER repairs damage in transcribed strands of active genes.<BR>Several of the proteins involved in NER are key components of the basal transcription complex TFIIH. An ubiquitin ligase complex composed of DDB1, CUL4A or CUL4B and RBX1 participates in both GG-NER and TC-NER, implying an important role of ubiquitination in NER regulation. The establishment of mutant mouse models for NER genes and other DNA repair-related genes has been useful in demonstrating the associations between NER defects and cancer.<BR>For past and recent reviews of nucleotide excision repair, please refer to Lindahl and Wood 1998, Friedberg et al. 2002, Christmann et al. 2003, Hanawalt and Spivak 2008, Marteijn et al. 2014).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1981	Thyroxine (thyroid hormone) production		Thyroxine hormone is produced in the thyroid gland from tyrosine and iodine. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is produced by the hypothalamus. It stimulates the production of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the anterior pituitary gland, which affects the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR). Iodine is captured by a hydrogen peroxide trap procuced by thyroid peroxidase and added to the 3' and 5' postitions of tyrosine. This can either be free tyrosine or a tyrosine residue in thyroglobuline. After the multiple iodination steps this produces T3 and T4. The production of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4),tri-iodothyronine (T3) and reverse T3 (rT3) is dependent on the organification of iodine into thyroglobulin (Tg), the major protein product of the thyroid (2). This involves thyroid peroxidase catalyzed iodination of tyrosine residues in Tg to form mono- and di-iodotyrosines and their subsequent crosslinking to form the iodothyronines T3 and T4.Iodine 131 is an important radioactive fallout product. It was released in the atmosphere after nuclear tests and after nuclear incidents like at Tchernobyl and Fukushima. Since the iodine is concentrated in the thyroid glant as a substrate for the process described here non-radioactive iodine 127 is given as competitor to people exposed.		9606

In addition, SREBP appears to be involved in a variety of other cellular processes. This pathway of SREBP focusses on the regulation of lipid metabolism by SREBP.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1991	SRF and miRs in smooth muscle differentiation and proliferation		Smooth muscle cells exhibit a unique plasticity, in that they are able to oscillate between proliferative and more quiescent, differentiated states. These two states are determined, in part, by a network of transcription factors, including Klf-4, Elk-1 and serum response factor (SRF), that regulate expression of genes controlling smooth muscle cell status. Two smooth muscle-enriched, co-transcribed microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-143 and miR-145, cooperatively target this transcription factor network to promote smooth muscle cell differentiation. miR-145 also acts in a positive feed-foward regulatory loop to enhance expression of the smooth muscle regulator, Myocardin (Myocd), which cooperates with SRF to activate transcription of miR-143/145. Conversely, the cardiac and skeletal muscle-enriched miRNA, miR-133, which is also under transcriptional control of both SRF and Mef2C, acts in a negative feed-back loop to decrease SRF translation. Other miRNAs, including miR-214 and miR-199a, also target SRF, limiting its activity in specific cell types.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2018	RANKL/RANK signaling pathway		RANKL (Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand), RANK (Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B) and the natural decoy receptor of RANKL, OPG (Osteoprotegerin) are three important molecules identified to play a major role in osteoclastogenesis and bone remodelling. They are members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. OPG was the first molecule to be discovered and proved to inhibit osteoclastogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. Unlike other members of TNF family, OPG lack a transmembrane domain and is secreted as a soluble protein by the cell. RANKL is the only known physiological agonist for its receptor, RANK. Genetic experiments have shown that mice lacking either rankl or rank suffer from severe osteoporosis and defective tooth eruption due to complete lack of osteoclasts. On the contrary, mice deficient of OPG shows osteoporosis due to increased number of osteoclasts. Binding of RANKL to RANK triggers downstream signaling events that leads to the activation of osteoclasts and controlling of lineage commitment. RANKL/RANK signaling is essential for skeletal homoeostasis and its interference leads to inhibition of bone resorption resulting in bone diseases including osteoporosis osteopetrosis and rheumatoid arthritis. RANK being a member of TNF family does not possess any kinase activity. It recruits adaptor molecules to transduce the signal after ligand binding. These adaptor molecules are called TNFR-associated factors or TRAF's that binds to different regions in the cytoplasmic tail of the TNF family receptors and transduces the signal downstream. TRAF6 is the main adaptor molecule which activates NF-κB pathway downstream of RANKL signaling which is required for osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activation. TRAF6 mutant mice have shown a partial block in osteoclastogenesis and defective activation of mature osteoclasts. Mice lacking NF-κB p50 and p52 proteins have been shown to be osteopetrotic. Catalytic subunits, IκB kinase α and IκB kinase β and the non-catalytic subunit IKKγ (also called NEMO) are also essential for RANKL-RANK signaling and osteoclastogenesis. IKKγ is required for osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL in mice both in vivo and in vitro whereas IKKα was shown to be required in mice only in in vitro. Several mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK's) have been shown to be activated downstream of RANK. Studies have shown that pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK's blocked RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation. JNK1/2, its upstream kinase MKK7 and c-Jun have also been shown by genetic experiments to be essential for RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis. MAPK1 and MAPK3 phosphorylation was also shown to be dispensable for RANKL mediated osteoclast differentiation in vitro, but another report also show that specific inhibitors to MEK increased RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis suggesting a cross talk between p38 and ERK signaling pathways. NFATc1 is an essential downstream target of RANK. Ca2+ oscillations induced by RANKL activated NFATc1 resulting in terminal differentiation of osteoclasts through the Ca2+- dependent calcineurin pathway. NFATc1 translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with other transcription factors leading to the activation of transcription of genes including ACP5, CTSK, TNFRSF11A and NFATc1 under RANKL stimulation. TRAF6 and c-Src interacts with each other and with RANK upon stimulation with RANKL. This interaction increases the kinase activity of c-Src leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream molecules such as c-Cbl and activation of Akt/PKB which in turn requires the PI3-Kinase activity. Genetic experiments have shown that c-Src is very important in osteoclastogenesis. In addition to these pathways, aPKC/p62 signaling is also reported to be essential for osteoclastogenesis. Apart from their role in osteoclast differentiation and function, RANKL-RANK signaling is also required for development of lymph node and lactating mammary glands in mice and in the establishment of thymic microenvironment.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/rankl_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite following paper: Raju, R., Balakrishnan, L., Nanjappa, V., Bhattacharjee, M., Getnet, D., Muthusamy, B., Thomas, J.

TSH binds to TSH receptor which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily of integral membrane proteins. TSH exerts its action through various signaling cascades such as cAMP cascade and the phospholipase C beta-mediated inositol phosphate generation. Further, it will give signaling to NF-kappa B, mitogen activated protein kinases, protein kinase C modules.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2034	Leptin signaling pathway		Leptin is a peptide hormone mainly synthesised and secreted from adipocytes. It is also expressed in other tissues including placenta, stomach and skeletal muscle. Leptin mediates its effects by binding to its receptor, leptin receptor (LEPR). LEPR belongs to gp130 family of cytokine receptor. LEPR is expressed in many tissues such as brain, adipose tissue, heart, placenta, lung and liver. Alternative splicing of LEPR results in six different isoforms, LEPRa, LEPRb, LEPRc, LEPRd, LEPRe and LEPRf. LEPRb is the longest isoform and possess signaling capacity. The role of other isoforms in leptin signaling is not clear. Leptin plays a major role in the regulation of energy homeostasis and regulate food intake and energy expenditure. Leptin is found to be transported to various regions of the brain across blood brain barrier. Impairment in leptin signaling across the blood brain barrier induces leptin resistance and thus obesity. Leptin is known to regulate reproduction, bone homeostasis and immune signaling. Leptin is also implicated in various physiological processers such as angiogenesis and hematopoiesis. LEPRb forms a homodimer and binds to leptin in 1:1 stoichiometry. This tetrameric receptor/ ligand complex appears to be essential for signaling. Leptin receptor lacks intrinsic kinase activity. It mediates multiple signaling pathways by binding to cytoplasmic kinases such as Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2). Activation of JAK2 by leptin promotes the tyrosine phosphorylation of LEPRb at Tyr-986, Try-1078 and Tyr-1141, thus activating LEPRb. Activation of leptin receptor with leptin activates signaling modules such as JAK/STAT, RAS/RAF/MAPK, IRS1/PI-3K, PLCγ and AMPK/ACC modules. Tyrosine phosphorylation of LEPRb induces binding of STATs to LEPRb. Binding of STATs to the phosphorylated residues of LEPR leads to the JAK2 mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STATs. Activated STATs translocate to the nucleus and induces expression of genes such as suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) and TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1). SOCS3 mediates feedback inhibition of leptin pathway by binding to Tyr-986 residue of LEPR. Cytosolic PTP1B also negatively regulates leptin pathway by dephosphorylating JAK2 and STAT3. Binding of leptin to its receptor results in the phosphorylation of PTPN1. Phosphorylated PTPN11 provides a docking site for GRB2, resulting in the activation of ERK module through RAS-RAF-MEK signaling. Leptin induces the activation of PI-3K by promoting the interaction and formation of SH2B/JAK2/IRS complex. Activation PI-3K mediates the activation of activation of protein kinases such as protein kinase B (AKT1) and downstream signaling cascades such as mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR), nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) and phosphodiesterase 3A, cGMP-inhibited (PDE3A). Activated AKT also regulates glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha/beta (GSK3A/B) proteins. IkappaB kinases (IKKs) are activated in response to AKT activation. Activated IKKs induce nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Leptin also regulates 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. AMPK function as energy sensor and is activated in response to rise in AMP to ATP ratio. Activated AMPK regulate fatty acid biosymthesis by regulating the activity the enzyme, fatty acid biosynthesis-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). PLC gamma is activated in response to leptin signaling. Activated PLC gamma regulate intracellular calcium levels and also protein kinase C activation by hydrolysing phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG).Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/Leptin_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite the following paper: Nanjappa, V., Raju, R., Muthusamy, B., Sharma, J., Thomas, J.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2035	Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) signaling pathway		The Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) is an anterior pituitary gonadotropin belonging to the family of glycoprotein hormones that includes thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), Leutinizing Hormone (LH) and Chorionic Gonadotropin. FSH controls the growth and maturation of follicles in the females and spermatogenesis in males. FSH is a heterodimer and shares a common alpha sub-unit with the other glycoprotein hormones in its family and has a specific beta subunit that confers receptor specificity and biological activity to the hormone. FSH acts through the FSH receptor (FSHR), a G protein coupled receptor  that is expressed exclusively on the granulosa cells of ovaries and Sertoli cells of the testis  in humans. FSH signaling involves activation of adenylyl cyclase activity and the increased production of cAMP. This activates the cAMP dependent protein kinases such as PKA, PKB and PKC that, in turn, lead to the phosphorylation of specific transcription factors such as cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1). In addition to activation of PI3K/Akt module, PKA also induces p38 mapk which, in turn, controls other kinase cascades. Activated Akt also induces the mTOR axis that stimulates mRNA translation by phosphorylating p70 S6 kinase and, consequently, the 40 S ribosomal protein S6 that results in the activation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E. It also indirectly aids in the activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs). FSH induces important genes required for steroidogenesis as well as growth and maturation of germ cells. The important target genes include aromatase (CYP19A1), the lutenizing hormone receptor (LHR) and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/fsh_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite following paper: Telikicherla, D., Ambekar, A., Palapetta, S.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2036	TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) signaling pathway		TNF related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) is a small pleiotropic cytokine of the TNF super family and its gene is located at chromosome 17p13.1. TWEAK has been reported to be expressed in tissues that include heart, brain, kidney and also in mononuclear blood cells. The multiple biological activities of TWEAK include stimulation of cell growth and angiogenesis, induction of inflammatory cytokines, and stimulation of apoptosis. It has been shown to be involved in the induction of cellular proliferation in liver cells, osteoblasts, astrocytes, synoviocytes, kidney cells and skeletal muscles. Furthermore, TWEAK plays a substantial role in cellular differentiation in osteoclasts. TWEAK induces glioma cell survival via imparting resistance to cytotoxic agents. It imparts its downstream signaling events by binding to its receptor, FGF inducible 14 protein (Fn14). Two modes of TWEAK-Fn14 (ligand-receptor) interactions have been proposed (i) the ligand dependent interaction which involves the higher concentration of homotrimeric TWEAK, that binds to low concentration of Fn14 in a heterohexameric complex (ii) ligand-independent interaction when the ligand concentration is lower than the receptor concentration which induces the ligand independent interaction. The receptors homotrimerize to activate the downstream events. The signaling cascades reported under TWEAK-Fn14 interactions are the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways and the MAPK pathway. There has been a report on crosstalk between Wnt and TWEAK pathways. In myoblasts the PI3K-AKT module has been reported to be inhibited under TWEAK stimulus. AKT phosprorylation leads to the activation of GSK3β resulting in increase of phospho-GSk3β and active β-catenin1 (CTNNB1) (dephosphorylated) levels. GSK3β and β-catenin1 remain associated in the cytoplasm, phosphorylation of GSK3β leads to the dissociation of β-catenin1 (dephosphorylated) resulting in the nuclear translocation of the protein. Despite of reports on TWEAK binding to other receptors including CD163 and DR3 the downstream events following the binding is yet to be established. The data provided by us would foster enormous avenues for further studies on TWEAK associated proteins and the related disorders such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. The data would enable therapeutic studies by selecting the pathological events and the simultaneous production of blocking agents. Despite the minimal amount of data, ours can also be used in the overlay of various high throughput data enabling pathway analysis and can be accessed by any pathway resource to generate a customized pathway.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/tweak_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite Bhattacharjee2012 paper (see below).Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2036 CPTAC Assay Portal].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2037	Prolactin signaling pathway		Prolactin (PRL), a pleiotropic polypeptide hormone, mostly secreted by the lactotrophic cells of anterior pituitary gland and to a lesser extent expressed in numerous extra pituitary tissues such as adipose tissue, lymphocytes, blood, plasma, skin fibroblasts, mammary epithelial cells, spleen, thymus, breast, prostate and sweat glands. Prolactin has been established to be present in all vertebrates and involved in more than 300 different effects, which can be ascribed to six broad categories: (i) reproduction and lactation, (ii) growth and development, (iii) endocrinology and metabolism, (iv) brain and behaviour, (v) immunomodulation and (vi) osmoregulation. Prolactin mediates its multiple functions through prolactin receptor (PRLR), a member of class I cytokine receptor superfamily. The PRLR comprises of an extracellular ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain. PRLR is expressed in a wide variety of tissues such as brain, mammary epithelium, liver, cerebellum and lymphocytes. Prolactin has been shown to be involved in the progression of different forms of cancer such as breast cancer and prostate cancer. Clinically, higher levels are found in patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Reiter's syndrome and Sjogren's syndrome. Besides 23 kDa full length PRL, a 16-kDa (16K PRL) N terminal fragment of prolactin produced by the cleavage by Cathepsin D has potent antiangiogenic and vasoconstrictive role in endothelial cells. In rat pulmonary fibroblasts cells 16K PRL is found to activate NF-kB pathway. Evidences also suggested that it has definite roles in programmed cell death in endothelial cells by activating various caspases. Prolactin associates with PRLR and induces the dimerization and activation of the receptor. The signaling reactions downstream of the long receptor isoform have been studied well and little is known about prolactin actions facilitated by short isoform. Since PRLR lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, it initiates signal transduction through its associated kinases in the cytoplasmic tail. PRL signaling activate Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3- kinase), Src kinase and serine/threonine kinase Nek3-vav2-Rac1 pathways through the long isoform of the receptor. The prolactin signaling through short isoform can activate different downstream cascades except JAK/STAT pathway. JAK2 phosphorylates multiple tyrosine residues of the receptor PRLR and enables the binding of downstream signaling molecules mainly signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. The STATs are considered as major effectors for PRL-dependent cell proliferation and gene activation, with STAT5 serving as the primary mediators. The phosphorylated STAT proteins dimmerize, translocate to the nucleus, and bind to specific DNA sequences in the promoters of PRL-induced genes, activating gene transcription. Prolactin signaling also activates MAP kinase pathways and is reported to be involved in proliferation of normal and mammary tumor cells. Prolactin also stimulates PI-3K pathway and is reported that activation of PI-3K/AKT pathway initiates cell survival of lymphoid cells. Upon prolactin stimulation, the adapter protein GAB2 phosphorylated at the tyrosine residue recruits the catalytic subunit of PI-3K. Apart from these, prolactin also regulates cytoskeletal re-organization through the activation of Rac pathway. The Prolactin receptor dependent interactions of serine/threonine kinases NEK3 with guanine nucleotide exchange factors VAV1 and VAV2 and Tec with VAV1 regulate cytoskeleton remodeling.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/NetSlim_56 NetSlim] database.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2037 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2038	Microtubule cytoskeleton regulation		"Microtubules (MTs) are essential for vesicle transport, cellular polarity and the segregation of chromosomes during mitosis. MTs are dynamic, undergoing assembly and depolymerization (primarily at the ""plus end"") by processes actively regulated by signaling pathways. The tubulin dimers that constitute MTs (depicted in green) are bound and sequestered by stathmin (STMN), enhancing MT dynamics by increasing rapid depolymerization (a.k.a., ""MT catastrophe""). MT dynamics are also enhanced by collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP2), which increases MT growth by promoting the addition of tubulin dimers onto microtubule plus ends. Other proteins that associate with assembled MTs include those that stabilize MTs (e.g. tau or MAPT), those that promote assembly (e.g., XMAP215), and those that maintain MTs in a dynamic state (e.g., MAP1B). Complexes between the adenomateous polyposis coli (APC) protein and plus end binding proteins (e.g., EB1) stabilize MTs by increasing the duration of the MT elongation phase. MT instability is promoted by several nonmotile kinesins from the kinesin-13 family, e.g., the mitotic centromere associated kinesin, MCAK, by accelerating the transition to catastrophe by weakening the lateral interactions between the protofilaments. Upstream from these processes, major signaling pathways act to regulate MT dynamics, e.g., those converging on GSK3B, a kinase which targets tau and CRMP2.Reference: https://www.cellsignal.com/contents/science-pathway-research-cytoskeletal/regulation-of-microtubule-dynamics-signaling-pathway/pathways-microProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2038 CPTAC Assay Portal]"		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP205	IL-7 signaling pathway		Interleukin-7 (IL-7) was discovered in the year 1988 as a factor that enhanced the growth of murine B-cell precursors in bone marrow culture system. It was also known as lymphopoietin 1and pre-B cell factor. IL-7 plays an important role in the development of B and T cells in mouse and T cells in humans. It is also essential for mature and naive T-cell's survival and proliferation. Human IL-7 gene maps to chromosome 8 and is about 72kb in length. The protein encoded by this gene is 177 amino acids in length with a molecular weight of 20 kDa. The active form of IL-7 in humans is a glycoprotein of 25 kDa. In humans IL-7 has been shown to be produced from intestinal epithelial cells, keratinocytes , hepatic tissues, peripheral blood dendritic cells, follicular dendritic cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. The IL-7 receptor consists of IL-7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7RÎ±) and a common gamma chain (Î³c). The gamma chain is also shared by IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21 receptors. The signaling pathways activated upon IL-7 binding to the receptor complex are JAK-STAT, PI-3 kinase and Src kinase pathways. JAK3, a protein tyrosine kinase is constitutively associated with the carboxy-terminal region of the gamma chain. Studies in mice lacking JAK3 have shown that it is required for transducing Î³c dependent signals. Mutations in JAK3 and Î³c have been shown to be associated with the autosomal recessive form of T-B + SCID. JAK1, another protein tyrosine kinase is associated with IL-7RÎ± chain and is activated upon IL-7 binding. JAK1 deficient mice shows severely impaired thymic development and no hematopoietic colony formation in response to IL-7. IL-7 would first bind to IL-7RÎ± and then associates with the gamma chain, bringing their intracellular domains bearing JAK1 and JAK3 together. JAK3 phosphorylates IL-7RÎ± chain creating docking sites for the transcription factors, STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5. JAK1 and JAK3 phosphorylate these STAT molecules and induces their dimerization and translocation to the nucleus where they activate specific target genes. PTK2B, a protein tyrosine kinase has been shown to be associated with JAK1 and plays an important role in the survival of thymocyte cell line. The enzymatic activity and its phosphorylation are highly induced by IL-7. PI-3 kinase pathway is also activated by IL-7 and this pathway is essential for the survival and proliferation of human T cell precursors. PI-3 kinase interacts with IL-7RÎ± upon IL-7 stimulation and activates its downstream target, AKT and its activation is mediated by Î³c. AKT in turn activates GSK3 beta and Bad, the death protein. Survival of pro T-cell survival by regulating Bad via PI3 kinase/AKT pathway is mediated by IL-7. IL-7 also mediates the downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B through the PI-3 kinase pathway and this effect is required for cell proliferation. IL-7 also induces the phosphorylation of a Src kinase family member, Fyn which is constitutively associated with IL7RA. In addition, IL-7 induces phosphorylation of MAPK family members including MAPK1 and MAPK3.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_7_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP22	IL-9 signaling pathway		IL-9 is a multifunctional cytokine, belonging to a family of cytokines. IL-9 was initially reported as a T cell growth factor in mice. It is now known to target multiple cell types. It plays an important role in the expansion and recruitment of mast cells in response to intestinal nematode infection or during autoimmune encephalomyelitis. It is also known to act on various cell types known to be involved in asthma including T cells, B cells, mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, and epithelial cells. IL-9 can promote the expression of TGF-beta in lipopolysaccharide-induced monocytes and macrophages. IL-9 is also known to play important roles in conditions including airway inflammation, EAE and parasitic infections. Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is activated transiently by IL-9, which in turn leads to the growth stimulation of hematopoietic cell lines. IL-9 signals through the heterodimeric receptor composed of a specific chain (IL-9R) and a gamma chain (IL2RG), which is shared between IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL15 and IL-21. The IL-9R and IL-2RG associates with JAK1 and JAK3 respectively. Receptor engagement results in JAK1- JAK3 cross phosphorylation and activation of the JAK proteins which leads to the activation of Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT-1, STAT-3 and STAT-5) and Insulin receptor substrate 1 and 2 (IRS1 and IRS2)/PI3K cascades. IL-9 stimulation also results in the activation of MEK/ERK signaling cascade.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_9_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

The main function of the androgen receptor is as a DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates gene expression. The AR is important for therapeutic target in prostate cancer, thus many different inhibitors have been developed, primarily targeting the ligand binding domain of the protein, while inhibitors that target the N-terminal domain of the protein are still under development.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP23	B cell receptor signaling pathway		The functional B-cell receptor is a multi-protein complex consisting of an antigen binding subunit and a signaling subunit. The antigen binding subunit is the membrane bound immunoglobulin and the signaling subunit consists of the IgÎ± and IgÎ² proteins, which are covalently bound to each other. Both IgÎ± and IgÎ² proteins have an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based activation motif (ITAM) each in its cytoplasmic region, which is responsible for the initiation and propagation of signaling. Antigen binding to the immunoglubulin results in the aggregation of both the immunoglobulin and the IgÎ±/Î² subunits. This results in the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the ITAM motif of the IgÎ±/Î² subunits by the src-family of protein tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk. The Src family kinases are initially in the proximity of the BCR as a result of membrane anchoring by virtue of its their acetylation. The N-terminal region of the kinases can also interact with the non-phosphorylated ITAMs of IgÎ±. This association is further enhanced upon BCR engagement as a result of accumulation in BCR containing lipid rafts and SH2 domain mediated binding to the phosphorylated tyrosine residues in ITAMs. This increased association helps in amplifying the BCR mediated signaling. Doubly phosphorylated IgÎ±/Î² ITAMs are necessary for efficient recruitment of Syk and its activation. Activated Syk then phsophorylates the adapter molecule B cell linker protein (BLNK), which acts as molecular scaffold for the recruitment of multiple effectors and hence the propagation of multiple signaling pathways. BLNK binds to Btk and PLCÎ³2 which results in optimal phosphorylation and activation of PLC. This is an important mechanism which links BCR to Ca2+ signaling. Apart from the PLC mediated Ca2+ signaling, BCR triggering also results in the the activaion of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K). This activation takes place through the recruitment of p85 adaptor subunit of PI-3K to CD19 co-receptor, which is phosphorylated by Lyn on its cytoplasmic Y-X-X-M motif. Alternatively, PI-3K can be recruited to the plasma membrane by other adapter molecules including PIK3AP, CBL or GAB1/2. PI-3K catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidyl inositol 3,4,5-bisphosphate. Akt, a serine threonine kinase, is recruited to the plasma membrane by virtue of its N-terminal PH-domain where it is activated by conformational changes and phosphorylation. Activated Akt phosphorylates several substrates resulting in diverse physiological consequences: Forkhead transcription factors - resulting in its degradation and hence inhibition of expression of pro-apoptotic genes, glycogen synthase kinase-3 GSK3 -leading to its inhibition and hence regulation of cell-cycle. The tanscription factor NF-kappaB is also found to be activated in BCR signaling in a Btk, PI-3K and PKC dependent manner. BCR engagement can also result in the association of GRB2/SOS complex with either SHC or BLNK, which results in the activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. This cascade leads to the activation of transcription factors including ELK and MYC. BCR activation also results in the activation of JNKs and p38MAPK.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/bcr_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP231	TNF-alpha signaling pathway		Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is a proinflammatory cytokine involved in various biological processes including regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and immune response. TNFα is mainly produced by macrophages, also by other tissues including lymphoid cells, mast cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and neuronal tissues. TNF was identified as a soluble cytokine produced upon the activation by the immune system and able to exert cytotoxicity on tumor cell lines and cause tumor necrosis in animal models. TNF is primarily produced as a type II transmembrane protein arranged as stable homotrimers. The members of TNFα family exert their cellular effect through two distinct surface receptors of the TNF receptor family, TNFRSF1A (TNF-R1) and TNFRSF1B (TNF-R2). TNF-R1 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas TNF-R2 is found typically on cells of the immune system and is highly regulated. TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 binds membrane-integrated TNF (memTNF) as well as soluble TNF (sTNF) TNF-R1 contains a protein-protein interaction domain, called death domain (DD). This domain interacts with other DD-containing proteins and couples the death receptors to caspase activation and apoptosis. TNF-R2 induces gene expression by a TRAF-2 dependent signaling mechanism and also crosstalk's with TNF-R1. The pleiotropic biological effects of TNF can be attributed to its ability to simultaneously activate multiple signaling pathways in cells. Binding of TNFα to TNF-R1 on the cell surface triggers trimerization of the receptor and exposes intracellular domain of TNF-R1 following the release of an inhibitory protein. This intracellular domain recruits a death-domain containing adaptor protein, TRADD by homophilic interactions. TRADD, which acts as a scaffold protein, recruits TRAF2 and RIPK1 to form a complex , referred to as complex 1.  Complex 1 is believed to be important in NF-κB activation and JNK activation. Complex 1 eventually dissociates from the receptor and integrates FADD and procaspase8 to form a complex referred to as the complex 2. In some cases, FADD/CASP8 association depends on high molecular weight complexes containing unubiquitinated RIPK1 as scaffold. Activated CASP8 induces CASP3 activity and execution of apoptosis. CASP8 activates apoptotic signal through another mechanism involving BID cleavage to truncated BID (tBID). tBID translocates to the mitochondria, increasing its outer membrane permeability. This results in cytochrome C release and activation of other caspases ultimately leading to apoptosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been found to increase during or after complex 1 and 2 formation to mediate or potentiate apoptosis upon TNF stimulation. TRAF-2 in complex 1 also activates the MAP kinase cascade, that leads to the activation of JNK, which on prolonged activation is believed to mediate both apoptosis and necrotic cell death.  On complex 1 formation, NF-κB regulated anti-apoptotic gene products efficiently block initiation of apoptosis by complex 2. There is evidence of an early attempt to signal for apoptosis, which precedes the activation of NF-κB. The intracellular part of TNF-R1 binds to NSMAF which in turn mediates SMPD2-dependant ceramide production from cell membrane. Ceramide induces membrane permeabilization and apoptosis. This is observed before TNF-R1 internalization and NF-κB activation. This process is repressed on TNF-R1 internalization. This signal however is enough to initiate apoptosis in some cells. Another form of cell death, necrosis, is also mediated through TNF stimulation. On TNF stimulation, deubiquitinated RIPK1 dissociates from complex 1 and recruits RIPK3, FADD and CASP8. RIPK3 is autophosphorylated and phosphorylates RIPK1. Taken together, it has been speculated that RIP1 and RIP3 increase carbohydrate and glutamine metabolism of the cell, leading to increased ROS production and eventual necrosis. Recruitment of CASP8, activation of FADD/RIP1 and apoptosis induction, is blunted when RIPK1 becomes ubiquitinated. IKBKG binds to ubiquitinated RIPK1 to induce the activation of NF-κB, which exerts antiapoptotic effects. Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis, BIRC2 and BIRC3 has E3-ubiquitin ligase activity and functionally interact with TRAF2 and RIPK1  to induce polyubiquitination of RIPK1 upon TNF stimulation. Loss of these inhibitors attenuates TNF-induced NF-κB activation. The adaptor proteins TAB2 and TAB3 bind preferentially to Lys-63 polyubiquitinated RIPK1. This facilitates dimerization of MAP3K7, promoting its phosphorylation and activation. The IKK complex, consisting of CHUK, IKBKB and IKBKG, is recruited to RIP1 through binding of IKBKG to the ubiquitin chain of RIP1. Activated TAK1 directly phosphorylates IKBKB within the activation loop, leading to activation of the IKK complex and NF-κB. Certain regulatory proteins have been known to intercept NF-κB activation at the level of ubiquitinated RIP1. TNFAIP3, an NF-κB inhibitory protein, removes Lys-63 polyubiquitin chain and promotes Lys-48 linked ubiquitination of RIPK1 leading to its degradation and NF-κB signal termination. IKBKG stabilizes the bound polyubiquitinated RIPK1 by inhibiting its degradation, most probably by impairing its interaction with TNFAIP3. OTUD7B is recruited to the activated TNF-R1 and promotes RIP1 deubiquitination, thereby attenuating NF-κB activation. At internalized TNF-receptosomes, RIPK1 is ubiquitinated by endocytic vesicle associated RFFL, inducing RIPK1 degradation, which terminates NF-κB activation. When successful, TNF-induced NF-κB activation induces transcription and expression of genes encoding proinflammatory IL-6, anti-apoptotic factors BIRC2, BIRC3 and BCL-2 homologue BCL2L1. This causes the cell to remain inert to apoptotic stimuli.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/tnf_alpha_pathway.html NetSlim] database.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP231 CPTAC Assay Portal].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2324	AGE/RAGE pathway		Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are heterogeneous group of non-enzymatic malliard reaction products of aldose sugar with proteins and lipids. Formation of AGEs is an indicator of one of the many chemical modifications of proteins and DNA that occur within the biological systems. Research over past two decades have implicated the role of AGEs in most of the age-related diseases like Alzheimer's disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, renal disorders, hypertension, stroke, visual impairment and skin disorders. AGEs also modify the skin collagen and accelerates the aging process. In diabetic patients, AGE formation occurs in large scale and manifests with clinical symptoms such as cataract, atherosclerosis, nephropathy and neuropathy.AGEs are known to bind with different cell surface receptors such as receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), dolichyldiphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycosyltransferase (AGE-R1), protein kinase C substrate, 80KH phosphoprotein (AGE-R2), galectin-3 (AGE-R3), and class A macrophage scavenger receptor types I and II.  RAGE, is the well-studied receptor for AGEs and the signaling events mediated by others are either not been identified or are considered as negative regulators of RAGE signaling. RAGE is an integral membrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily. RAGE is constituted of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic domain. RAGE is expressed in a wide range of tissues such as lung, heart, kidney, brain, skeletal muscles, and in different types of cells including endothelial cells, macrophages/monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. Besides AGEs, RAGE also mediate the effects of its other extracellular ligands namely extracellular high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), S100 family of calcium binding proteins and amyloid-beta peptide, among many others. Although a large number of advanced glycation end products have been identified in humans, AGE/RAGE signaling ex-vivo is mostly studied using the AGEs such as AGE-modified albumin, N(6)(carboxymethyl)lysine, N(6)(carboxyethyl)lysine and pentosidine.The signaling events mediated by RAGE are complex due to the diversity of its ligands and their effects in different cell types. Homodimerization of RAGE has been identified to be essential for RAGE signaling. Depending on the intensity and duration of RAGE ligation, specific signaling modules such as ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, CDC42/RAC, SAPK/JNK and NF-κB has been shown to be regulated in different cell types. AGEs have been shown to induce the formation of complexes containing RAGE with DIAPH1, SRC/IRS1/PKC-alpha, TIRAP/MYD88/IRAK4 and RHOA. RAGE-DIAPH1 interaction is required for the activation of RAC1/CDC42 pathway leading to neurite outgrowth and regulation of cytoskeleton.Activation of PKC-alpha through RAGE/SRC/IRS1/PKC-alpha by AGEs has been suggested as a mechanism of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle cells. RAGE also shares the adaptor molecules such as TIRAP, MYD88 and IRAK4 of toll-like receptors and induce the activation of AKT, p38MAPK and NFKB pathways. AGEs have also been shown to induce the formation of complex between RAGE and RHOA. RHOA/ROCK dependent phosphorylation of ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) is required for the regulation of gap formation and actin reorganization, and thereby endothelial permeability. However, in tubular cells, AGEs inhibit phosphorylation of ERMs leading to inhibition of tubulogenesis. Similarly, AKT have been shown to be activated by AGEs and induce proliferation of primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells where as phosphorylation of AKT is shown to be inhibited in podocytes leading to FOXO4 activation and apoptosis. The major component of AGE/RAGE signaling is the oxidative stress induced pathways. AGEs induce the oxidative stress through the activation of NADPH oxidases. Increased intracellular oxidative stress leads to stimulation of PKC and ERK1/2, resulting in the translocation and activation of NF-κB and subsequent up regulation of NF-κB dependent genes which ultimately produce deleterious effects to cells.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2328	Allograft rejection		This pathway illustrates molecular interactions involved in the fundamental adaptive immune response for allograft destruction. This pathway was adapted in large part from [http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/hsa/hsa05330.html KEGG]. In the initial step of this diagram, antigen presenting cells (APC's), either those from the donor (direct pathway) or from the recipient (indirect pathway) activate naive t cells leading to both CD8+ and CD4+ T cell maturation. CD8+ stimulated T cells lead to apoptosis of the allograft donor cells whereas CD4+ T cells differentiate into TH1, TH2, T17, and Treg cells. Activated TH1 produces TNFA and NO and damages donor graft cells by cytotoxicity. TH2 cell activates B cells. Activated B cells lead to plasma cell formation followed by IgG antibodies and the complement cascade pathway in acute antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) and chronic AMR with C3 being the therapeutic target. Exogenous treatment with YCF inhibits C3, thus preventing AMR. Eculizumab binds to C5 which prevent C5a production and the membrane attack complex.  C3a and C35 act as potent chemotactic factors, promoting the infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells. Belatacept inhibits CD80/86 binding to CD28. Corticosteroids inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2332	Interleukin-11 signaling pathway		IL-11 is a multifunctional cytokine that belongs to the gp130 family. It was first isolated from a primate bone marrow derived cell line, PU-34 for its ability to stimulate the proliferation of a plasmacytoma cell line, T1165 which was dependent on IL-6. This cytokine plays an important role in the synthesis, maturation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. It  also plays significant role in the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation, regulation of trophoblasts invasion and placentation in humans. The receptor for IL-11 is IL11RA that uses the common gp130 receptor subunit for signal transduction. The pathways that are activated upon IL-11 stimulation are JAK-STAT, Ras-MAPK, PI3K-AKT and NF-kappa B/p65. Binding of IL-11 with IL-11RA results in the heterodimerization, tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of gp130. The activated IL11RA-gp130 receptor complex further activates Jak family of tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and JAK2. Phosphorylated JAK2 then activates STAT3 and STAT1 that results in their subsequent translocation into the nucleus. The translocated STAT3 then induces the transcription of genes associated with endometrial cell adhesion, gastric inflammation and differentiation of periodontal ligament cells. The activation of STAT3 was shown to be inhibited by the overexpression of Suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3). IL-11 signalling through JAK2/STAT3 has been shown to be crucial for normal placentation in humans and normal development of craniofacial bones and teeth in mice.In addition to JAK-STAT, IL-11 also activate the Ras-MAPK, PI3K-AKT and NF-kappa B pathways. In response to IL-11, GTP loaded Ras interacts with RAF1 and leads to autophosphorylation of RAF1. Activation of RAF1 leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) through MEK1 and MEK2. Activation of phospholipase D was triggered by IL-11 leading to the formation of phosphatidic acid, which has also been shown to activate the MAPKs. Transcription factors, ATF1 and CREB1 were activated by these phosphorylated MAPKs through p90 S6 kinase. PI3K-AKT and NF-kappa B/p65 pathways stimulated by IL-11 have been shown to enhance the migration and proliferation of chondrosarcoma cells. In CD4+ T cells, Th2 polarization was induced by IL-11 through NF-kappa B inhibition. SRC, FYN and YES, members of Src family of tyrosine kinases were also activated in response to IL-11 signalling.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_11_pathway NetSlim] database.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2332 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2355	Corticotropin-releasing hormone signaling pathway		Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a neuropeptide secreted abundantly in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, amygdala, cerebral cortex and cerebellum in the central nervous system. It is also expressed in adrenal gland, placenta, testis, spleen, gut, thymus and skin. CRH is the principal mediator of endocrine stress response. CRH also plays a significant role in inflammatory responses, hemodynamic actions, stromal cell decidualization during estrus cycle, implantation of blastocyst, maintenance of pregnancy, onset of labor  and neuroprotection. Excess secretion of CRH during severe depression and its association with increased levels of cortisol have been observed. CRH has also been reported to be involved in anxiety disorders, anorexia nervosa. Decrease in cortical CRH content has been observed in Alzheimer's disease  and Parkinson's disease.The actions of CRH are mediated through class II/secretin-like family type of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) called the CRH receptors (CRHR). CRH is a high affinity ligand of CRHR1 and also binds to CRHR2 but with lower affinity. CRH receptors do not have any intrinsic kinase activity and transduce the signal via the heterotrimeric G-proteins. The CRH receptors are rapidly desensitized by G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) and Î²-arrestin mechanisms in the presence of high concentrations of CRH. Binding of CRH to CRH receptor induces a conformational change in the receptor by activating it. This further activates GÎ±-subunit and its subsequent dissociation from the GÎ²Î³ dimer. CRH receptors on interaction with GÎ±-subunit of different G-proteins such as GÎ±s, GÎ±i/o, GÎ±q/11 activate numerous downstream signaling cascades and result in the induction of various cellular responses. The pathways that are activated upon CRH stimulation are: Adenylate cyclase/cAMP/PKA, PLC/PKC, ERK/MAPK, PI3K-AKT and NF-kappa B. CRH binding to CRHR1 couples G-stimulatory (Gs) protein which in turn activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Activation of PKA leads to the phosphorylation of transcription factors like cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), which in turn increases the expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene and the release of POMC-derived peptides, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and Î²-endorphin. ACTH, in turn, stimulates the secretion of glucocorticoids from adrenal glands and thereby mediates changes associated with stress response. CREB also regulates genes containing the Ca2+/cAMP response element such as FOS. The activation of cAMP by CRH induces the mRNA expression and transcription of orphan nuclear receptors NR4A1 and NR4A2, which in turn transcriptionally activates the expression of POMC. Activation of cAMP/PKA can also induce the expression of enzymes involved in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and cortisol production. The biological functions of CRH are also mediated by MAPK family, in particular MAPK1/3 and MAPK14. MAPK1/3 mediates activation of transcription factors NR4A1 and NR4A2 and induction of POMC in corticotrophs. MAPK14 is involved in CRH-induced inhibition of IL-18 expression in human keratinocytes. The CRHR1/PKA/ERK signaling activate the transcription factors - ELK1, SP1 and TFAP2A. SP1 and TFAP2A up-regulates the expression of ADRBK2, which causes the desensitization of CRHR1 receptors.The PLC/PKC pathway is activated by coupling of the CRH receptors to the GÎ±q/11 proteins. This cascade stimulates the formation of IP3 and contributes to the mobilization of intracellular calcium. Calcium is involved in the transcription regulation of FOS as well as NR4A1 and NR4A2 through CAMK2A. PLC/PKC is involved in the activation of AP-1 complex and subsequent transcriptional regulation of genes involved in keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation â€“ KRT1, KRT14 and IVL. This cascade also inhibits the expression of CYP11A1 and HSD3B1, the genes involved in progesterone synthesis in placental trophoblasts. Another important signaling pathway activated upon CRH stimulation is the nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP, involved in the control of vascular tone. In human keratinocytes, upon CRH stimulation, NFKBIA degradation is diminished and the activity of NFKB is inhibited resulting in the down-regulation of NFKB-dependent genes IL2 and HSP90AA1 and inhibition of cell proliferation. The gene involved in cell survival, BCL2 is transcriptionally regulated via the PI3K/AKT.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2371	Parkinson's disease pathway		Most people with Parkinson's disease have idiopathic Parkinson's disease (having no specific known cause). A small proportion of cases, however, can be attributed to known genetic factors. Mutations in specific genes have been conclusively shown to cause PD. These genes code for alpha-synuclein (SNCA), parkin (PRKN), leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2 or dardarin), PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), DJ-1 and ATP13A2.[4][22] In most cases, people with these mutations will develop PD. With the exception of LRRK2, however, they account for only a small minority of cases of PD.[4] The most extensively studied PD-related genes are SNCA and LRRK2. Mutations in genes including SNCA, LRRK2 and glucocerebrosidase (GBA) have been found to be risk factors for sporadic PD. The role of the SNCA gene is important in PD because the alpha-synuclein protein is the main component of Lewy bodies.[22] Missense mutations of the gene (in which a single nucleotide is changed), and duplications and triplications of the locus containing it have been found in different groups with familial PD. Mutations in LRRK2 are the most common known cause of familial and sporadic PD, accounting for approximately 5% of individuals with a family history of the disease and 3% of sporadic cases.Sources: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease wikipedia], [https://www.qiagen.com/geneglobe/pathwayview.aspx?pathwayID=345 Qiagen], and [http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/hsa/hsa05012.html KEGG].Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2371 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2374	Oncostatin M signaling pathway		Oncostatin M (OSM) is a member of the multifunctional cytokine interleukin 6 (IL6) - type cytokine family. It is mainly produced in cell types such as activated T lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils and in microglial cells. OSM signaling is initiated by the interaction of the cytokine to either: the type I LIFR-gp130 receptor complex, or to the type II OSMR-gp130 receptor [O’Hara et al]. The major downstream signaling pathways that are activated in OSM signaling are JAK/STAT, Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K pathways [Halfter, Halfter, Stross, Brantley]. As the receptors lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, associated JAKs (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2) phosphorylate OSM receptor complex and STATs (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A, STAT5B, STAT6) [O’Hara, Fritz, Migita, Hintzen]. Phosphorylated STATs form homodimeric complexes (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5B) or heterodimeric complex (STAT1-STAT3) and translocate to the nucleus. Once inside nucleus STAT proteins bind to regulatory elements in the promoter of OSM-responsive genes and regulate the gene expression [O’Hara, Halfter, Halfter, Hintzen]. Alternatively, OSM induced phosphorylation of PTPN11, GRB2, SHC1, Ras/Raf molecules can bring about the activation of ERK1/2 signaling module [O’Hara]. Oncostatin M -through ERK1/2 signaling module induces the phosphorylation of CEBPB, both CEBPB and EGR1 stimulates the transcription of genes involved in lipid metabolism [Zhang]. Although OSM also causes induced phosphorylation in MAPK family members (MAPK8/9/14) the functional importance of this is at present not well understood [O’Hara, Li]. OSM mediated signaling cascade is negatively regulated by JAK1 inhibition by SOCS3 and STAT3 inhibition by PIAS3 [Stross, Brantley, Chung]. OSM also induced the activation of caspase family members (CASP3, CASP7, CASP9) through the JAK2 module and regulates apoptosis [Auernhammer, Tiffen, Chipoy]. In osteosarcoma cells OSM is found to mediate apoptosis through a less understood STAT5B signaling module [Chipoy].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2380	Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway		Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin essential for growth, differentiation, plasticity, and survival of neurons. BDNF is also required for processes such as energy metabolism, behavior, mental health, learning, memory, stress, pain and apoptosis. BDNF is implicated in various neuronal disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, depression, and bipolar disorder.BDNF binds to tyrosine kinase receptor known as tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB). It also binds with low affinity to p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). BDNF and its receptors are expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system.BDNF signaling is elicited when it dimerizes and binds to TrkB, resulting in the receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation. The activation of the receptor results in its interaction with molecules such as Shp2, Shc and PLC-gamma. These molecules further interact and modify their downstream targets leading to various neuronal processes. BDNF activates the signaling cascades such as PLC/PKC, PI3K/Akt, Ras/Erk, AMPK/ACC and NFκB pathways. BDNF through PLC/PKC pathway leads to release of intracellular calcium and regulation of synaptic plasticity. It also maintains synaptic plasticity through cAMP/PKA signaling. Activation of PI3K/Akt pathway through BDNF/TrkB interaction inhibits cell apoptosis by decreasing the expression of BIM. However, BDNF/p75NTR interaction activates JNK through TRAF6, which leads to apoptosis. Activation of JNK3 also leads to proteolytic cleavage of the p75NTR by TACE. PI3K/Akt also leads to activation of mTOR pathway and subsequently protein synthesis. Ras/Erk signaling is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and protection of neurons. BDNF also leads to neuronal survival through Erk5/Mef pathway. Phosphorylation of synapsin by Erk1/2 leads to neurotransmitter release. BDNF signaling leads to nitric oxide production through NFκB pathway. BDNF induces neurite outgrowth through activation of JAK/STAT, Rac, and Cdc42 pathways. BDNF enhances oxidation of fat through AMPK mediated inhibition of ACC. It also plays role in microtubule assembly through inhibition of GSK3-beta. It leads to oxidative neuronal necrosis through activation of NCF molecules. BDNF also regulates the surface expression of AMPA and NMDA receptors. BDNF also regulates the expression of genes leading to processes such as differentiation of dendrites and calcification of cementoblast-like cells.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2380 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP241	One-carbon metabolism		This one-carbon metabolism pathway is centered around folate. Folate has two key carbon-carbon double bonds. Saturating one of them yields dihydrofolate (DHF) and adding an additional molecule of hydrogen across the second yields tetrahydrofolate (THF). Folates serve as donors of single carbons in any one of three oxidation states: 5-methyl-THF (CH3THF; reduced), 5,10 methylene-THF (CH2THF; intermediate) and 10-formyl-THF (CHOTHF; oxidized). The single carbon donor CH3THF is used to convert homocysteine into methionine which can then be used to methylate DNA, the donor CH2THF is used (along with a molecule of hydrogen at the site of one of the double bonds) to convert dUMP (deoxyuridylate) into dTMP (thymidylate) and the donor CHOTHF is used to set up ring closure reactions in de novo purine synthesis. CH3THF is the primary methyl-group donor for processes such as DNA methylation reactions. Purines are used both in RNA synthesis and in DNA synthesis and dTMP is synthesized srtictly for DNA synthesis, be it for DNA repair or DNA replication.The folate pathway is central to any study related to DNA methylation, dTMP synthesis or purine synthesis.Differential methylation (e.g. hypermethylation of tumor suppressors) as well as disturbances in nucleotide synthesis and repair, are associated with several forms of cancer. There are also indications that hypermethylation is involved in the progression of adenomas to cancer. The pathway is also illustrative of the role of a number of B vitamins, including vitamin B12 (cobalamine) which is important for the sythesis of folate (vitamin B9) and of methionine.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2431	Spinal cord injury		This pathway provides an overview of cell types, therapeutic targets, drugs, new proposed targets and pathways implicated in spinal cord injury. Spinal cord injury is a complex multistep process that involves the regulation of gene expression and signaling in motor neurons, oligodentrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes that trigger immediate immune responses lasting several weeks. Within 24 hours, chemoattractants  and cytokines released from the site of injury activate neutrophils which further recruit B and T cells or recruit monocytes that ultimately result in infiltration and activation by microglia and macrophages. These immune responses result in inflammation, excitotoxicity, cell death, formation of glial scar, and suppression of axonal regeneration. An increase in the expression of cell cycle genes further results in proliferation of astrocytes and microglia that leads to apoptosis and necrosis of oligodentrocytes and neurons. An example therapy is the administration of the immunosuppressant FK506, also used in transplantation to offer neuroprotection.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2431 CPTAC Assay Portal].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2435	Quercetin and Nf-kB / AP-1 induced apoptosis		Quercetin is a flavonoid that is widely distributed in nature. In this pathway, its dual nature is depicted. On the one hand, it is capable of exerting anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the PLA2-induced conversion of cell membrane phospholipids to arachidonic acid, reducing the downstream synthesis of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins; furthermore, inhibition of NF-kB and AP-1 transcription factor activation also contribute to these effects.On the other hand, quercetin itself may - paraxodically - generate ROS, as well as facilitate the activation of NFE2L2, which results in the production of CYP2A6. This isotype of CYP450 was found to be involved in the formation of carcinogenic metabolites. Both of these effects culminate in DNA damage.  It has been observed, however, that these pro-oxidant effects are dominant at higher concentrations, whereas anti-oxidant effects are dominant at lower concentrations. Based on this, it has been suggested that quercetin may have a scavenging effect.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2436	Dopamine metabolism		"Dopamine is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families that plays several important roles in the brain and body. It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical L-DOPA, which is synthesized in the brain and kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals. The dopamine system plays a central role in several significant medical conditions, including Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is an age-related disorder characterized by movement disorders such as stiffness of the body, slowing of movement, and trembling of limbs when they are not in use. The main symptoms are caused by the loss of dopamine-secreting cells in the substantia nigra. These dopamine cells are especially vulnerable to damage, and a variety of insults, including encephalitis (as depicted in the book and movie ""Awakenings""), repeated sports-related concussions, and some forms of chemical poisoning such as MPTP, can lead to substantial cell loss, producing a parkinsonian syndrome that is similar in its main features to Parkinson's disease.The most widely used treatment for parkinsonism is administration of L-DOPA, the metabolic precursor for dopamine. L-DOPA is converted to dopamine in the brain and various parts of the body by the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase. L-DOPA is used rather than dopamine itself because, unlike dopamine, it is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier.Description source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine Wikipedia]Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2436 CPTAC Assay Portal]"		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP244	Alpha 6 beta 4 signaling pathway		The integrin alpha6beta4 was discovered in the late 1980s by two different groups and was called either alphaEbeta4 or Ic-Ic binding protein (Ic-IcBP) (1,2). The alpha6beta4 integrin is a component of Hemidesmosomes (HDs) (3, 4,5). Increased expression of alphaEbeta4 and changes in its distribution is found to be correlated with increased aggressiveness of tumors and poor prognosis (6, 7). Although integrin alpha6beta4, can interact with different laminin isoforms, its preferred ligand in the epidermal BM is laminin-5 (8, 9). The beta4 integrin is a large protein and has a cytoplasmic domain of more than 1000 amino acids (10, 11). This domain contains a Na-Ca exchanger (CalX) motif followed by two pairs of type III fibronectin (FNIII) domains separated by a connecting segment (CS). It is found to associate with the intermediate filament system through plectin and BP230, which are components of hemidesmosomes (12,13,14). Interaction of intgrin beta4 with components of hemidesmosomes including plectin, BP230 and BP180 is found to be important in signaling events associated with cell growth, survival, and migration under physiological and pathological conditions.Studies have shown that beta4 can regulate keratinocyte migration both positively and negatively (15,16,17,18). It is also found to regulate cell survival in keratinocytes in cell culture systems under stress in a PI3K/Akt pathway dependent manner (19,18). However, alpha6beta4 was not found to have any effect on keratinocyte survival in vivo (20, 18, 16). Apart from its effects on keratinocytes, evidence suggests that integrin alpha6beta4 is important in cancer cell invasion (21,22,23,24) and survival (25,26,27,28,16,29). The cancer cell invasion is regulated through a IRS/PI3K dependent process while the effect on carcinoma cell survival in a PI3K/Akt and dependent manner. Activation of the transcription factors NFkappaB and NF-IL6 in a p38Mapk dependent pathway and subsequent activation of IL6 gene expression was shown to be mechanism of alpha6beta4 induced survival of thymocytes and proliferation of thymic epithelial cells (27,30). Integrin alpha6beta4 is also known activate the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade which is found to be involved in the regulation of cell cycle (31,32,33,34).NetPath (http://www.netpath.org) is a collaborative project between PandeyLab at Johns Hopkins University (http://pandeylab.igm.jhmi.edu) and the Institute of Bioinformatics (http://www.ibioinformatics.org).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2447	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)		Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, lethal, degenerative disorder of motor neurons. The hallmark of this disease is the selective death of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, leading to paralysis of voluntary muscles. Mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), as seen in some familial ALS (FALS) cases, is unstable, forming aggregates in the motor neuron cytoplasm, axoplasm and mitochondria. Within mitochondria, mutant SOD1 may interfere with the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2, affect mitochondrial import by interfering with the translocation machinery (TOM/TIM), and generate toxic free radicals (ROS). Reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced within mitochondria, inhibit the function of EAAT2, the main glial glutamate transporter protein, responsible for most of the reuptake of synaptically released glutamate. Glutamate excess increases intracellular calcium, which enhances oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. Mutant SOD1 can also trigger oxidative reactions , which can then cause damage through the formation of hydroxyl radicals or via nitration of tyrosine residues on proteins. Nitration may target neurofilament proteins, affecting axonal transport. Collectively, these mechanisms are predicted to disturb cellular homeostasis, ultimately triggering motor neuron death.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2447 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2453	TCA cycle and deficiency of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc)		When transported into the inner mitochondrial matrix, pyruvate encounters two principal metabolizing enzymes: pyruvate carboxylase, PC (a gluconeogenic enzyme) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), the first enzyme of the PDH complex (PDHc). With a high cell-energy charge, co-enzyme A (CoA) is highly acylated, principally as acetyl-CoA, and able to obligately activate pyruvate carboxylase, directing pyruvate toward gluconeogenesis. When the energy charge is low, CoA is not acylated, therefore, pyruvate carboxylase is inactive, and pyruvate is preferentially metabolized via the PDHc and the TCA cycle to CO2 and H2O. The acetyl-CoA produced by the PDHc enters the TCA cycle and the reduced electron carriers (NADH and FADH2) that are generated during the oxidative reactions can then be used to drive ATP synthesis via oxidative phosphorylation.Description source: [https://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/tca-cycle.php The Medical Biochemistryp Page]Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2453 CPTAC Assay Portal].		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2485	NAD biosynthesis II (from tryptophan)		"As a general rule, most prokaryotes utilize the aspartate de novo pathway, in which the nicotinate moiety of NAD is synthesized from aspartate (see NAD biosynthesis I (from aspartate)). In eukaryotes, the de novo pathway starts with tryptophan (this pathway).The role of tryptophan as a precursor in eukaryotic NAD biosynthesis was first suggested by nutritional studies in which humans stricken with pellagra, a nicotinamide (niacine) deficiency disease, recovered after the addition of tryptophan or niacin to their diets (Krehl et al). Other studies established tryptophan as a precursor of NAD in many animal and plant systems (Foster et al). This pathway is closely related to the catabolic pathway of tryptophan (tryptophan degradation I (via anthranilate)), suggesting an evolutionary link between the two.Though rare, the synthesis of NAD from tryptophan in prokaryotes has been observed in several organisms. Wilson and Henderson reported that Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni requires niacin for growth and can use tryptophan or 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid as a substitute [Wilson63]. Some members of the Actinomycete group were also reported to utilize tryptophan for NAD biosynthesis (Lingens et al).Recent studies based on comparative genome analysis have identified the five genes involved in the ""eukaryotic"" pathway in several bacterial strains, confirming that some bacteria may indeed utilize this pathway rather than the aspartate pathway (Kurnasov et al).In yeast, the de novo pathway consists of six enzymatic steps (catalyzed by the products of the BNA genes) and one non-enzymatic reaction. After the last enzymatic reaction (catalyzed by Bna6p), the de novo pathway converges with the salvage pathway (Panozzo et al).In plants:In plants current evidence strongly supports the NAD biosynthetic route from L-aspartate (NAD biosynthesis I (from aspartate)). However, the finding of gene homologs encoding enzymes of the early steps in the kynurenine pathway (this pathway) in the genome sequence of rice (Oryza sativa) does not rule out this pathway in monocotyledones and remains to be further investigated (Katoh et al).Adapted from   [http://biocyc.org/META/new-image?type=PATHWAY&object=NADSYN-PWY&detail-level=3&ENZORG=TAX-9606 BioCyc]."		9606

Recent studies suggest that deregulated microRNA (miRNA) expression promotes invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. There is a putative oncogenic miRNA, miR-21, whose expression is correlated with HER2/neu up-regulation and is functionally involved in HER2/neu-induced cell invasion. miR-21 is up-regulated via the MAPK (ERK1/2) pathway upon stimulation of HER2/neu signaling in breast cancer cells, and overexpression of other ERK1/2 activators such as RASV12 or ID-1 is sufficient to induce miR-21 up-regulation in HER2/neu-negative breast cancer cells. Furthermore, the metastasis suppressor protein PDCD4 (programmed cell death 4) is down-regulated by miR-21 in breast cancer cells expressing HER2/neu. There is a mechanism for HER2/neu-induced cancer cell invasion via miRNA deregulation. miR-21 is a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of breast cancer invasion and metastasis.		9606

Extensive research on the phenotype and the recent discovery and cloning of the responsible gene point to a defect as a central biochemical locus which links several signal transduction pathways that operate under stress as well as in normal physiological conditions.Ataxia is the first symptom in all patients and is predominantly truncal, first manifested in swaying of the head and trunk on standing and even sitting. Truncal ataxia precedes appendicular cerebellar disease. In the first years of life, certain manifestations are present such as dysarthria, muscular hypotonia, the slow initiation and performance of all voluntary movements, characteristic hypotonic facies and postures, and drooling. Dyssynergia and intention tremor of the upper extremities become a major feature after the fifth year of life. The tendon reflexes are diminished or lost, but may be normal or even hyperactive in the early stages. All these observations show a clear ataxia of cerebellar type, initially of station and gait, and later of intention. Early observations of brains from patients with A-T showed neurodegenerative changes, particularly in the Purkinje and granular cells of the cerebellum. Neuronal degeneration is also present in the brainstem, and dentate and olivary nuclei atrophy. Neuronal loss occurs in the substantial nigra and oculomotor nuclei, dorsal root ganglia, and degenerative changes are evident in spinal motor neurons, and dorsal root and sympathetic motor neurons. Moreover, multiple abnormalities in Purkinje cell development have been observed in an Atm-deficient mouse model. Misplaced Purkinje cells have been observed in both the granular and molecular cell layers. In addition, Purkinje cell dendrites tend to grow laterally instead of extending towards the surface of the cerebellum.ATM (for Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) has been located by restriction-fragment length polymorphism in the chromosome 11, location: 108,093,211-108,239,829. Interestingly, the site of ATM is the same or adjacent to the region occupied by CD3 (Antigen, Delta subunit), THY1 (T-Cell antigen), and NCAM (Cell Adhesion Molecule, Neural, 1) genes, all of which are members of the immunoglobulin-gene superfamily and consequently may be subject to the same defect that afflicts the T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin molecules in A-T. The ATM gene presents an open reading frame (ORF) of 9,165 kb cDNA and is constituted by 66 exons spread over 150 kb of genomic DNA which has a transcript of 12 kb. The ORF of this transcript predicts a 370-kDa protein composed of 3056 amino acids. Over 300 mutations have been found in A-T patients, distributed across the full length (150 kb of genomic DNA) of the ATM gene.Sequence homology indicates that the atm gene product falls into a family of proteins that are related to the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). This family includes TEL1, MEC1, TOR1, and TOR2 of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, RAD3 of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and MEI-41 of Drosophila melanogaster. The mammalian family member most closely related to ATM is the ATR/FRP1 protein and, like its yeast homologs, it mediates cellular responses to unreplicated or damaged DNA. In humans the PI 3-kinase family includes the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) and FRAP. These sequence homologies appear to reflect functional homology because many of the PI 3-kinase family members are involved in DNA repair, recombination and cell cycle control. Despite the resemblance to lipid kinases, members of this family, including ATM, possess a serine/threonine protein kinase activity, which is wortmannin sensitive.ATM phosphoprotein is ubiquitously expressed and predominantly found in nuclei of proliferating cells, but subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence revealed that 10-20% of the protein is present in cytoplasmic vesicles, including peroxisomes and endosomes and a prominent cytoplasmic fraction in mouse oocytes. ATM is endosome-bound in mouse neurons, suggesting molecular sorting of the protein occurs in the cytoplasm. In Purkinje cells, distribution of ATM protein is primarily in cytoplasm, and this may be related to the differentiation state of the cells. ATM mRNA is present in all human and mouse tissues. In situ hybridization shows that ATM mRNA is expressed throughout the whole mouse embryo. Furthermore, ATM has been associated with beta-adaptin in lymphoblast vesicles indicating that it may play a role in intracellular vesicle and/or protein transport mechanisms. No obvious nuclear localization signals have been detected in ATM. Neither an ectopically expressed N-terminal fragment of the protein nor a C-terminal fragment is capable of entering the nucleus.		9606

The A-, B-, C-, and D-chain genes of PDGF are localized to the chromosomes 7p22, 22q13, 4q31, and 11q22, respectively, and their expression is independently regulated. Two forms of the PDGF A-chain, containing 196 and 211 amino acid residues resulting from differential splicing of the transcript, are synthesized, dimerized, proteolytically processed in the Nterminus, and secreted from the cell as a ~30 kDa dimer. The PDGF B chain encoding 241 amino acid residues is dimerized, processed by additional proteolysis, and secreted as a 24 kDa dimer. The homodimers PDGF AA, BB, and the heterodimer AB contain three intrachain disulfide bonds made between the 1st.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2526 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2533	Glycerophospholipid biosynthetic pathway		Glycerophospholipids or phosphoglycerides, in which the hydrophobic regions are composed of two fatty acids joined to glycerol; and sphingolipids, in which a single fatty acid is joined to a fatty amine, sphingosine, are glycerol-based phospholipids and the main component of biological membranes. The hydrophilic moieties in these amphipathic compounds may be as a simple as a single -OH at one end of the sterol ring system, or they may be more complex. Glycerophospholipds, as well as sphingolipids, contained polar or charged alcohols at their polar ends; some also contain phosphate groups.In glycerophospholipids, two fatty acids are ester-linked to glycerol at C-1 and C-2, and a highly polar or charged (and therefore hydrophilic) head group is attached to C-3 through a phosphodiester bond. All glycerophospholipds are derivatives of phosphatidic acid and are named for their polar head groups (e.g., phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine). All have a negative charge on the phosphate group at pH 7.0. The head-goup alcohol may also contribute one or more charges at pH near 7.0. The fatty acids in glycerophospholipds can be any of a wide variety. They are different in different species, in different tissues of the same species, and in different types of glycerophospholipids in the same cell or tissue. In general, glycerophospholipids contain a saturated fatty acid at C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid at C-2, and, in general terms, the fatty acyl groups are generally 16 or 18 carbons long.Eukaryotic membranes contain significant amounts of two other types of glycerophospholipids: Plasmalogens and Alkylacylglycerophospholipids. Plasmalogens contain a hydrocarbon chain linked to glycerol C-1 via vinyl ether linkage whereas alkylacylglycerophospholipids the alkyl substituent at glycerol C-1 is attached via an ether linkage. About 20% of mammalian glycerophospholipids are plasmalogens, this percentage varies both from species to species and from tissue to tissue within a given organism. While plasmalogens comprise only about 0.8% of the phospholipids in human liver, they account for around 23% of those in human nervous tissue. The alkylacylglycerophospholipids are less abundant than the plasmalogens, e.g., about 59% of ethanolamine glycerophospholipids of human heart are plasmalogens, whereas only 3.6% are alkylacylglycerophospholipids. However, in bovine erythrocytes, 75% of the ethanolamine glycerophospholipids are of alkylacyl type.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2572	Primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)		"Primary or idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) a cause of nephrotic syndrome in children and adolescents, as well as an important cause of end stage renal disease in adults. FSGS is mainly associated with foot process effacement, proliferation of mesangial, endothelial and epithelial cells in the early stages followed by collapse of glomerular capillaries leading to scarring. It may lead to dramatic manifestations such as proteinuria, hypoaluminemia, and hypertension. Also, there are many inheritable genetic abnormalities that can cause podocyte damage of FSGS caused by mutations in proteins that are important for podocyte function. The genes include CD2AP, MYO1E, WNT1, and LAMB2.On the far left, the diagram illustrates molecular interactions between a normal podocyte and matrix interactions. ACTN4 and SYNPO and DAG1 interacting with AGRN associate with the actin cytoskeleton; these actin associated proteins might play a role in maintaining podocyte and GBM architecture. DAG1 binds to UTRN, which in turn binds an actin filament, thus completing the link between the actin-based cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. Podocyte foot processes are anchored to the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) via ITGB1 and ITGA3 integrin complex and DAG1-UTRN complex. Transmembrane proteins such as LAMA5 and CD151 bind to ITGB1 and ITGA3, respectively. The intracellular integrins combine with cytoskeletal via intermediates which include TLN1, VCL, and PAX complex and the ILK, PARVA, and LIMS1 complex. (Guanghua Hu et. al 2013 - Biomedicine and Aging Pathology vol 3)Upon primary podocyte injury, there are multiple pathways involved in podocyte injury. ""Sustaining NPHS1 and phosphorylation might contribute to both anti-apoptotic signaling and actin polymerization. The CD80 pathway may be targeted by TLR4 or blocking the binding of B7-1 to slit diaphragm structure proteins such as KIRREL2/3. PLAUR could be inhibited by interfering with binding of PLAUR and ITGAV/B3 integrin, inhibiting ITGB3 integrin activation, or inhibiting binding of ITGAV/B3 integrin to VTN. The notch pathway can be targeted by interfering with its upstream activation by blocking the TGF-β1 effect, inhibiting γ-secretase, which is required for proteolytic receptor activation, or interfering with target gene transcription."" (Reiser J. et al 2010 - Kidney Int vol 77) Post podocyte development, increased activation of NOTCH1 and WNT/CTNNB1 activities contribute to glomerulosclerosis. Expression of JAG1 on the ligand-expressing cell induces proteolytic cleavage of the Notch receptor on the signal-receiving cell, releasing the NOTCH1. DKK1 inhibits WNT1 binding to LRP5/6. By inhibiting the destruction of CTNNB1, CTNNB1 is stablilized. ""The CTSL pathway could be targeted by specifically inhibiting CTSL expression or activity, shifting the equilibrium of SYNPO toward the phosphorylated form by inhibiting calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation or enhancing PKA or CAMK2B-mediated phosphorylation, protecting SYNPO and DNM1 by compounds that bind to the CTSL cleavage site, or delivering cleavage-resistant SYNPO and DNM1 mutants."" (Reiser J. et al 2010 - Kidney Int vol 77)The destruction of podocyte's cytoskeleton architecture leads to lose of normal podocyte epitopes such as VIM, SYNPO, and WT1, and lose of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors CDKN1C and CDKN1B. Also, podocytes acquire proliferation of CDKN1A. This leads to podocytopenia which have been shown to cause primary FSGS and then followed by end-stage renal disease (ESRD). FSGS is also induced by microRNA-193a and its downregulation of WT1, destroying podocyte foot processes.There is insufficient evidence that segmental glomerular lesions can be caused by other drugs or toxins, apart from some used experimentally such as doxorubicin and puromycin aminonucleoside. Treatments such as steroids, high-dose cyclosporine, ritxuximab can reduce proteinuria based on their immunosuppressive properties and through stabilization of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton.

In lung epithelial cells, NPs interact with both EGFR and integrins, leading to cell proliferation via activation of PI3K and AKT. NPs were shown to activate the EGFR, leading in parallel to apoptosis and proliferation, and oncogenic Ras mutations might influence these effects. Interestingly, while integrin-mediated activation of ERK was instrumental for proliferation, apoptosis was mediated via activation of JNK. In addition, NPs (PM2.5) are able to bind the EGFR to activate the MAPK signaling cascade. Activation of ERK leads to the expression and secretion of the epidermal growth factor amphiregulin, thus forming an autocrine loop, which might be instrumental for sustained inflammatory responses.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2650	Arachidonic acid metabolism		Eicosanoids, oxygenated, 20-carbon fatty acids, are autocrine and paracrine signaling molecules that modulate physiological processes including pain, fever, inflammation, blood clot formation, smooth muscle contraction and relaxation, and the release of gastric acid. Eicosanoids are  synthesized in humans primarily from arachidonic acid (all-cis 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid) that is released from membrane phospholipids. Once released, arachidonic acid is acted on by prostaglandin G/H synthases (PTGS, also known as cyclooxygenases (COX)) to form prostaglandins and thromboxanes, by arachidonate lipoxygenases (ALOX) to form leukotrienes, epoxygenases (cytochrome P450s and epoxide hydrolase) to form epoxides such as 15-eicosatetraenoic acids, and omega-hydrolases (cytochrome P450s) to form hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (Buczynski et al. 2009, Vance & Vance 2008).<br>Levels of free arachidonic acid in the cell are normally very low so the rate of synthesis of eicosanoids is determined primarily by the activity of phospholipase A2, which mediates phospholipid cleavage to generate free arachidonic acid. The enzymes involved in arachidonic acid metabolism are typically constitutively expressed so the subset of these enzymes expressed by a cell determines the range of eicosanoids it can synthesize.<br>Eicosanoids are unstable, undergoing conversion to inactive forms with half-times under physiological conditions of seconds or minutes.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2653	PIP3 activates AKT signaling		Signaling by AKT is one of the key outcomes of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation. AKT is activated by the cellular second messenger PIP3, a phospholipid that is generated by PI3K. In ustimulated cells, PI3K class IA enzymes reside in the cytosol as inactive heterodimers composed of p85 regulatory subunit and p110 catalytic subunit. In this complex, p85 stabilizes p110 while inhibiting its catalytic activity. Upon binding of extracellular ligands to RTKs, receptors dimerize and undergo autophosphorylation. The regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85, is recruited to phosphorylated cytosolic RTK domains either directly or indirectly, through adaptor proteins, leading to a conformational change in the PI3K IA heterodimer that relieves inhibition of the p110 catalytic subunit. Activated PI3K IA phosphorylates PIP2, converting it to PIP3; this reaction is negatively regulated by PTEN phosphatase. PIP3 recruits AKT to the plasma membrane, allowing TORC2 to phosphorylate a conserved serine residue of AKT. Phosphorylation of this serine induces a conformation change in AKT, exposing a conserved threonine residue that is then phosphorylated by PDPK1 (PDK1). Phosphorylation of both the threonine and the serine residue is required to fully activate AKT. The active AKT then dissociates from PIP3 and phosphorylates a number of cytosolic and nuclear proteins that play important roles in cell survival and metabolism.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2657	Growth hormone receptor signaling		Growth hormone (Somatotropin or GH) is a key factor in determining lean body mass, stimulating the growth and metabolism of muscle, bone and cartilage cells, while reducing body fat. It has many other roles; it acts to regulate cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and reorganisation of the cytoskeleton, affecting diverse processes such as cardiac function, immune function, brain function, and aging.  GH also has insulin-like effects such as stimulating amino acid transport, protein synthesis, glucose transport, and lipogenesis. The growth hormone receptor (GHR) is a a member of the cytokine receptor family. When the dimeric receptor binds GH it undergoes a conformational change which leads to phosphorylation of key tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic domains and activation of associated tyrosine kinase JAK2. This leads to recruitment of signaling molecules such as STAT5 and Src family kinases such as Lyn leading to ERK activation. The signal is attenuated by association of Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS) proteins and SHP phosphatases which bind to or dephosphorylate specific phosphorylated tyrosines on GHR/JAK. The availability of GHR on the cell surface is regulated by at least two processes; internalization and cleavage from the suface by metalloproteases.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2658	HIV Life Cycle		The life cycle of HIV-1 is divided into early and late phases, shown schematically in the figure. In the <b>early</b> phase, an HIV-1 virion binds to receptors and co-receptors on the human host cell surface (a), viral and host cell membranes fuse and the viral particle is uncoated (b), the viral genome is reverse transcribed and the viral preintegration complex (PIC) forms (c), the PIC is transported through the nuclear pore into the nucleoplasm (d), and the viral reverse transcript is integrated into a host cell chromosome (e). In the <b>late</b> phase, viral RNAs are transcribed from the integrated viral genome and processed to generate viral mRNAs and full-length viral genomic RNAs (f), the viral RNAs are exported through the nuclear pore into the cytosol (g), viral mRNAs are translated and the resulting viral proteins are post-translationally processed (h), core particles containing viral genomic RNA and proteins assemble at the host cell membrane and immature viral particles are released by budding. The released particles mature to become infectious (j), completing the cycle (Frankel and Young 1998; Miller and Bushman 1997).<br>Most of the crucial concepts used to describe these processes were originally elucidated in studies of retroviruses associated with tumors in chickens, birds, and other animal model systems, and the rapid elucidation of the basic features of the HIV-1 life cycle was critically dependent on the intellectual framework provided by these earlier studies.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2659	Deadenylation-dependent mRNA decay		After undergoing rounds of translation, mRNA is normally  destroyed by the deadenylation-dependent pathway. Though the trigger is unclear, deadenylation likely proceeds in two steps: one catalyzed by the PAN2-PAN3 complex that shortens the poly(A) tail from about 200 adenosine residues to about 80 residues and one catalyzed by the CCR4-NOT complex or by the PARN enzyme that shortens the tail to about 10-15 residues.<br>After deadenylation the mRNA is then hydrolyzed by either the 5' to 3' pathway or the 3' to 5' pathway. It is unknown what determinants target a mRNA to one pathway or the other.<br>The 5' to 3' pathway is initiated by binding of the Lsm1-7 complex to the 3' oligoadenylate tail followed by decapping by the DCP1-DCP2 complex. The 5' to 3' exoribonuclease XRN1 then hydrolyzes the remaining RNA.<br>The 3' to 5' pathway is initiated by the exosome complex at the 3' end of the mRNA. The exosome processively hydrolyzes the mRNA from 3' to 5', leaving only a capped oligoribonucleotide. The cap is then removed by the scavenging decapping enzyme DCPS.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2662	Vasopressin regulates renal water homeostasis via aquaporins		In the kidney water and solutes are passed out of the bloodstream and into the proximal tubule via the slit-like structure formed by nephrin in the glomerulus. Water is reabsorbed from the filtrate during its transit through the proximal tubule, the descending loop of Henle, the distal convoluted tubule, and the collecting duct.<br>Aquaporin-1 (AQP1) in the proximal tubule and the descending thin limb of Henle is responsible for about 90% of reabsorption (as estimated from mouse knockouts of AQP1). AQP1 is located on both the apical and basolateral surface of epithelial cells and thus transports water through the epithelium and back into the bloodstream.<br>In the collecting duct epithelial cells have AQP2 on their apical surface and AQP3 and AQP4 on their basolateral surface to transport water across the epithelium. The permeability of the epithelium is regulated by vasopressin, which activates the phosphorylation and subsequent translocation of AQP2 from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2664	Gastrin-CREB signaling pathway via PKC and MAPK		Gastrin is a hormone whose main function is to stimulate secretion of hydrochloric acid by the gastric mucosa, which results in gastrin formation inhibition. This hormone also acts as a mitogenic factor for gastrointestinal epithelial cells. Gastrin has two biologically active peptide forms, G34 and G17.Gastrin gene expression is upregulated in both a number of pre-malignant conditions and in established cancer through a variety of mechanisms. Depending on the tissue where it is expressed and the level of expression, differential processing of the polypeptide product leads to the production of different biologically active peptides. In turn, acting through the classical gastrin cholecystokinin B receptor CCK-BR, its isoforms and alternative receptors, these peptides trigger signalling pathways which influence the expression of downstream genes that affect cell survival, angiogenesis and invasion (Wank 1995, de Weerth et al. 1999, Grabowska & Watson 2007) View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=881907 Reactome].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2665	Neurotoxicity of clostridium toxins		Clostridial neurotoxins, when taken up by human neurons, block synaptic transmission by cleaving proteins required for the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane. They are remarkably efficient so that very small doses cause paralysis of an affected person (Lalli et al. 2003; Turton et al. 2002). All characterized clostridial neurotoxins are synthesized as products of chromosomal, plasmid  or prophage-borne bacterial genes. The nascent toxin may be cleaved into light (LC) and heavy (HC) chain moieties that remain attached by noncovalent interactions and a disulfide bond (Turton et al. 2002).<p>Strains of Clostridium botulinum produce seven serologically distinct toxins, BoNT/A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. An eighth toxin, BoNT/H has recently been identified (Barash & Arnon 2014) but its molecular properties have not yet been described. Human poisoning most commonly  result from ingestion of toxin contaminated food. More rarely, it is due to wound infection or clostridial colonization of the gut of an infant whose own gut flora have not yet developed or of an older individual whose flora have been suppressed. While all seven characterized toxins can cleave human target proteins, three, BoNT/A, B, and E, are most commonly associated with human disease (Hatheway 1995; Sakaguchi 1982). BoNT/F is also able to cause human botulism.<p>Once ingested, the botulinum toxin must be taken up from the gut lumen into the circulation, a process mediated by four accessory proteins. These proteins form a complex that mediates transcytosis of the toxin molecule across the gut epithelium, allowing its entry into the circulation. The accessory proteins produced by different C. botulinum strains differ in their affinities for polarized epithelia of different species (e.g., human versus canine), and may thus be a key factor in human susceptibility to the toxins of strains A, B, and E and resistance to the others (Simpson 2004).<p>Clostridium tetani produces TeNT toxin. Human poisoning is the result of toxin secretion by bacteria growing in an infected wound and the toxin is released directly into the circulation.<p>Circulating clostridial toxins are taken up by neurons at neuromuscular junctions. They bind to specific gangliosides (BoNT/C, TeNT) or to both gangliosides and synaptic vesicle proteins (BoNT/A, B, D G) exposed on the neuronal plasma membrane during vesicle exocytosis (Montal 2010). All seven characterized forms of BoNT are thought to be taken up into synaptic vesicles as these re-form at the neuromuscular junction. These vesicles remain close to the site of uptake and are rapidly re-loaded with neurotransmitter and acidified (Sudhoff 2004). TeNT, in contrast, is taken up into clathrin coated vesicles that reach the neuron cell body by retrograde transport and then possibly other neurons before undergoing acidification. Vesicle acidification causes a conformational change in the toxin, allowing its HC part to function as a channel through which its LC part is extruded into the neuronal cytosol. The HC - LC disulfide bond is cleaved and the cytosolic LC functions as a zinc metalloprotease to cleave specific bonds in proteins on the cytosolic faces of synaptic vesicles and plasma membranes that normally mediate exocytosis (Lalli et al. 2003; Montal 2010).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2666	Elastic fibre formation		Elastic fibres (EF) are a major structural constituent of dynamic connective tissues such as large arteries and lung parenchyma, where they provide essential properties of elastic recoil and resilience. EF are composed of a central cross-linked core of elastin, surrounded by a mesh of microfibrils, which are composed largely of fibrillin. In addition to elastin and fibrillin-1, over 30 ancillary proteins are involved in mediating important roles in elastic fibre assembly as well as interactions with the surrounding environment. These include fibulins, elastin microfibril interface located proteins (EMILINs), microfibril-associated glycoproteins (MAGPs) and Latent TGF-beta binding proteins (LTBPs). Fibulin-5 for example, is expressed by vascular smooth muscle cells and plays an essential role in the formation of elastic fibres through mediating interactions between elastin and fibrillin (Yanigasawa et al. 2002, Freeman et al. 2005). In addition, it plays a role in cell adhesion through integrin receptors and has been shown to influence smooth muscle cell proliferation (Yanigasawa et al. 2002, Nakamura et al. 2002). EMILINs are a family of homologous glycoproteins originally identified in extracts of aortas. Found at the elastin-fibrillin interface, early studies showed that antibodies to EMILIN can affect the process of elastic fibre formation (Bressan et al. 1993). EMILIN1 has been shown to bind elastin and fibulin-5 and appears to coordinate their common interaction (Zanetti et al. 2004). MAGPs are found to co-localize with microfibrils. MAGP-1, for example, binds strongly to an N-terminal sequence of fibrillin-1. Other proteins found associated with microfibrils include vitronectin (Dahlback et al. 1990).<br><br>Fibrillin is most familiar as a component of elastic fibres but microfibrils with no elastin are found in the ciliary zonules of the eye and invertebrate circulatory systems. The addition of elastin to microfibrils is a vertebrate adaptation to high pulsatile pressures in their closed circulatory systems (Faury et al. 2003). Elastin appears to have emerged after the divergence of jawless vertebrates from other vertebrates (Sage 1982). <br><br>Fibrillin-1 is the major structural component of microfibrils. Fibrillin-2 is expressed earlier in development than fibrillin-1 and may be important for elastic fiber formation (Zhang et al. 1994). Fibrillin-3 arose as a duplication of fibrillin-2 that did not occur in the rodent lineage. It was first isolated from human brain (Corson et al. 2004).<br><br>Fibrillin assembly is not as well defined as elastin assembly. The primary structure of fibrillin is dominated by calcium binding epidermal growth factor like repeats (Kielty et al. 2002). Fibrillin may form dimers or trimers before secretion. However, multimerisation predominantly occurs outside the cell. Formation of fibrils appears to require cell surface structures suggesting an involvement of cell surface receptors. Fibrillin is assembled pericellularly (i.e. on or close to the cell surface) into microfibrillar arrays that undergo time dependent maturation into microfibrils with beaded-string appearance. Transglutaminase forms gamma glutamyl epsilon lysine isopeptide bonds within or between peptide chains. Additionally, intermolecular disulfide bond formation between fibrillins is an important contributor to fibril maturation (Reinhardt et al. 2000).<br><br>Models of fibrillin-1 microfibril structure suggest that the N-terminal half of fibrillin-1 is asymmetrically exposed in outer filaments, while the C-terminal half is buried in the interior (Kuo et al. 2007). Fibrillinopathies include Marfan syndrome, familial ectopia lentis, familial thoracic aneurysm, all due to mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene FBN1,  and congenital contractural arachnodactyly which is caused by mutation of FBN2 (Maslen & Glanville 1993, Davis & Summers 2012).<br><br>In vivo assembly of fibrillin requires the presence of extracellular fibronectin fibres (Sabatier et al. 2009). Fibrillins have Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequences that interact with integrins (Pfaff et al. 1996, Sakamoto et al. 1996, Bax et al., 2003, Jovanovic et al. 2008) and heparin-binding domains that interact with a cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (Tiedemann et al. 2001) possibly a syndecan (Ritty et al. 2003). Fibrillins also have a major role in binding and sequestering growth factors such as TGF beta into the ECM  (Neptune et al. 2003). Proteoglycans such as versican (Isogai et al. 2002), biglycan, and decorin (Reinboth et al. 2002) can interact with the microfibrils. They confer specific properties including hydration, impact absorption, molecular sieving, regulation of cellular activities, mediation of growth factor association, and release and transport within the extracellular matrix (Buczek-Thomas et al. 2002). In addition, glycosaminoglycans have been shown to interact with tropoelastin through its lysine side chains (Wu et al. 1999), regulating tropoelastin assembly (Tu & Weiss 2008).<br><br>Elastin is synthesized as a 70kDa monomer called tropoelastin, a highly hydrophobic protein composed largely of two types of domains that alternate along the polypeptide chain. Hydrophobic domains are rich in glycine, proline, alanine, leucine and valine. These amino acids occur in characteristic short (3-9 amino acids) tandem repeats, with a flexible and highly dynamic structure (Floquet et al. 2004). Unlike collagen, glycine in elastin is not rigorously positioned every 3 residues. However, glycine is distributed frequently throughout all hydrophobic domains of elastin, and displays a strong preference for inter-glycine spacing of 0-3 residues (Rauscher et al. 2006). <br><br>Elastic fibre formation involves the deposition of tropoelastin onto a template of fibrillin rich microfibrils. Recent results suggest that the first step of elastic fiber formation is the organization of small globules of elastin on the cell surface followed by globule aggregation into microfibres (Kozel et al. 2006). An important contribution to the initial stages assembly is thought to be made by the intrinsic ability of the protein to direct its own polymeric organization in a process termed 'coacervation' (Bressan et al. 1986). This self-assembly process appears to be determined by interactions between hydrophobic domains (Bressan et al. 1986, Vrhovski et al. 1997,  Bellingham et al. 2003, Cirulis & Keeley 2010) which result in alignment of the cross-linking domains, allowing the stabilization of elastin through the formation of cross-links generated through the oxidative deamination of lysine residues, catalyzed by members of the lysyl oxidase (LOX) family (Reiser et al. 1992, Mithieux & Weiss 2005). The first step in the cross-linking reaction is the oxidative formation of the delta aldehyde, known as alpha aminoadipic semialdehyde or allysine (Partridge 1963). Subsequent reactions that are probably spontaneous lead to the formation of cross-links through dehydrolysinonorleucine and allysine aldol, a trifunctional cross-link dehydromerodesmosine and two tetrafunctional cross-links desmosine and isodesmosine (Lucero & Kagan 2006), which are unique to elastin. These cross-links confer mechanical integrity and high durability. In addition to their role in self-assembly, hydrophobic domains provide elastin with its elastomeric properties, with initial studies suggesting that the elastomeric propereties of elastin are driven through changes in entropic interactions with surrounding water molecules (Hoeve & Flory 1974). <br><br>A very specific set of proteases, broadly grouped under the name elastases, is responsible for elastin remodelling (Antonicelli et al. 2007). The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are particularly important in elastin breakdown, with MMP2, 3, 9 and 12 explicitly shown to degrade elastin (Ra & Parks 2007). Nonetheless, elastin typically displays a low turnover rate under normal conditions over a lifetime (Davis 1993).

However, iron can also enter and leave cells not only by itself, but also in the form of heme and siderophores. When entering the cell via the main path (by transferrin endocytosis), its goal is not the (still elusive) chelated iron pool in the cytosol nor the lysosomes but the mitochondria, where heme is synthesized and iron-sulfur clusters are assembled (Kurz et al,2008, Hower et al 2009, Richardson et al 2010).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2671	Defensins		The defensins are a family of antimicrobial cationic peptide molecules which in mammals have a characteristic  beta-sheet-rich fold and framework of six disulphide-linked cysteines (Selsted & Ouellette 2005, Ganz 2003). Human defensin peptides have two subfamilies, alpha- and beta-defensins, differing in the length of peptide chain between the six cysteines and the order of disulphide bond pairing between them. A third subfamily, the theta defensins, is derived from alpha-defensins prematurely truncated by a stop codon between the third and fourth cysteine residues. The translated products are shortened to nonapeptides, covalently dimerized by disulfide linkages, and cyclized via new peptide bonds between the first and ninth residues. Humans have one pseudogene but no translated representatives of the theta class.<br>In solution most alpha and beta defensins are monomers but can form dimers and higher order structures. <br><br>The primary cellular sources of defensins are neutrophils, epithelial cells and intestinal Paneth cells.Those expressed in neutrophils and the gut are predominantly constitutive, while those in epithelial tissues such as skin are often inducible by proinflammatory stimuli such as LPS or TNF-alpha.<br><br>Defensins are translated as precursor polypeptides that include a typical signal peptide or prepiece that is cleaved in the Golgi body, and a propiece, cleaved by differing mechanisms to produce the mature defensin. Mature defensin peptides can be further processed by removal of individual N-terminal residues (Yang et al. 2004). This may be a mechanism to broaden the activity profile of defensins (Ghosh et al. 2002).<br><br>Defensins have direct antimicrobial effects and kill a wide range of Gram-positive and negative bacteria, fungi and some viruses. The primary antimicrobial action of defensins is permeabilization of microbial target membranes but several additional mechanisms have been suggested (Brogden 2005, Wilmes et al. 2011). Defensins and related antimicrobial peptides such as cathelicidin bridge the innate and acquired immune responses. In addition to their antimicrobial properties, cathelicidin and several defensins show receptor-mediated chemotactic activity for immune cells such as monocytes, T cells or immature DCs, induce cytokine production by monocytes and epithelial cells, modulate angiogenesis and stimulate wound healing (Yang et al. 1999, 2000, 2004, Rehaume & Hancock 2008, Yeung et al. 2011).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2672	ISG15 antiviral mechanism		Interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is a member of the ubiquitin-like (Ubl) family. It is strongly induced upon exposure to type I Interferons (IFNs), viruses, bacterial LPS, and other stresses. Once released the mature ISG15 conjugates with an array of target proteins, a process termed ISGylation. ISGylation utilizes a mechanism similar to ubiquitination, requiring a three-step enzymatic cascade. UBE1L is the ISG15 E1 activating enzyme which specifically activates ISG15 at the expense of ATP. ISG15 is then transfered from E1 to the E2 conjugating enzyme UBCH8 and then to the target protein with the aid of an ISG15 E3 ligase, such as HERC5 and EFP. Hundreds of target proteins for ISGylation have been identified. Several proteins that are part of antiviral signaling pathways, such as RIG-I, MDA5, Mx1, PKR, filamin B, STAT1, IRF3 and JAK1, have been identified as targets for ISGylation. ISG15 also conjugates some viral proteins, inhibiting viral budding and release. ISGylation appears to act either by disrupting the activity of a target protein and/or by altering its localization within the cell.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2673	Interleukin-7 signaling		Interleukin-7 (IL7) is produced primarily by T zone fibroblastic reticular cells found in lymphoid organs, and also expressed by non-hematopoietic stromal cells present in other tissues including the skin, intestine and liver. It is an essential survival factor for lymphocytes, playing a key anti-apoptotic role in T-cell development, as well as mediating peripheral T-cell maintenance and proliferation. This dual function is reflected in a dose-response relationship that distinguishes the survival function from the proliferative activity; low doses of IL7 (<1 ng/ml) sustain only survival, higher doses  (>1 ng/ml) promote survival and cell cycling (Kittipatarin et al. 2006, Swainson et al. 2007).<br><br>The IL7 receptor is a heterodimeric complex of the the common cytokine-receptor gamma chain (IL2RG, CD132, or Gc) and the IL7-receptor alpha chain (IL7R, IL7RA, CD127). Both chains are members of the type 1 cytokine family. Neither chain is unique to the IL7 receptor as IL7R is utilized by the receptor for thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) while IL2RG is shared with the receptors for IL2, IL4, IL9, IL15 and IL21. IL2RG consists of a single transmembrane region and a 240aa extracellular region that includes a fibronectin type III (FNIII) domain thought to be involved in receptor complex formation. It is expressed on most lymphocyte populations. Null mutations of IL2RG in humans cause X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID), which has a phenotype of  severely reduced T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell populations, but normal numbers of B cells. In addition to reduced T- and NK-cell numbers, Il2rg knockout mice also have dramatically reduced B-cell populations suggesting that Il2rg is more critical for B-cell development in mice than in humans. Patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) phenotype due to IL7R mutations (see Puel & Leonard 2000), or a partial deficiency of IL7R (Roifman et al. 2000) have markedly reduced circulating T cells, but normal levels of peripheral blood B cells and NK cells, similar to the phenotype of IL2RG mutations, highlighting a requirement for IL7 in T cell lymphopoiesis. It has been suggested that IL7 is essential for murine, but not human B cell development, but recent studies indicate that IL7 is essential for human B cell production from adult bone marrow and that IL7-induced expansion of the progenitor B cell compartment is increasingly critical for human B cell production during later stages of development (Parrish et al. 2009).<br><br>IL7 has been shown to induce rapid and dose-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of JAKs 1 and 3, and concomitantly tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA-binding activity of STAT5a/b (Foxwell et al. 1995). IL7R was shown to directly induce the activation of JAKs and STATs by van der Plas et al. (1996). Jak1 and Jak3 knockout mice displayed severely impaired thymic development, further supporting their importance in IL7 signaling (Rodig et al. 1998, Nosaka et al. 1995).<br><br>The role of STAT5 in IL7 signaling has been studied largely in mouse models. Tyr449 in the cytoplasmic domain of IL7RA is required for T-cell development in vivo and activation of JAK/STAT5 and PI3k/Akt pathways (Jiang et al. 2004, Pallard et al. 1999). T-cells from an IL7R Y449F knock-in mouse did not activate STAT5 (Osbourne et al. 2007), indicating that IL7 regulates STAT5 activity via this key tyrosine residue. STAT5 seems to enhance proliferation of multiple cell lineages in mouse models but it remains unclear whether STAT5 is required solely for survival signaling or also for the induction of proliferative activity (Kittipatarin & Khaled, 2007).<br><br>The model for IL7 receptor signaling is believed to resemble that of other Gc family cytokines, based on detailed studies of the IL2 receptor, where IL2RB binds constitutively to JAK1 while JAK3 is pre-associated uniquely with the IL2RG chain. Extending this model to IL7 suggests a similar series of events: IL7R constitutively associated with JAK1 binds IL7, the resulting trimer recruits IL2RG:JAK3, bringing JAK1 and JAK3 into proximity. The association of both chains of the IL7 receptor orients the cytoplasmic domains of the receptor chains so that their associated kinases (Janus and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases) can phosphorylate sequence elements on the cytoplasmic domains (Jiang et al. 2005). JAKs have low intrinsic enzymatic activity, but after mutual phosphorylation acquire much higher activity, leading to phosphorylation of the critical Y449 site on IL7R. This site binds STAT5 and possibly other signaling adapters, they in turn become phosphorylated by JAK1 and/or JAK3. Phosphorylated STATs translocate to the nucleus and trigger the transcriptional events of their target genes.<br><br>The role of the PI3K/AKT pathway in IL7 signaling is controversial. It is a potential T-cell survival pathway because in many cell types PI3K signaling regulates diverse cellular functions such as cell cycle progression, transcription, and metabolism. The ERK/MAPK pathway does not appear to be involved in IL7 signaling (Crawley et al. 1996).<br><br>It is not clear how IL7 influences cell proliferation. In the absence of a proliferative signal such as IL7 or IL3, dependent lymphocytes arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. To exit this phase, cells typically activate specific G1 Cyclin-dependent kinases/cyclins and down regulate cell cycle inhibitors such as Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (Cdkn1b or p27kip1). There is indirect evidence suggesting a possible role for IL7 stimulated activation of PI3K/AKT signaling, obtained from transformed cell lines and thymocytes, but not confirmed by observations using primary T-cells (Kittipatarin & Khaled, 2007). IL7 withdrawal results in G1/S cell cycle arrest and is correlated with loss of cdk2 activity (Geiselhart et al. 2001), both events which are known to be regulated by the dephosphorylating activity of Cdc25A. Expression of a p38 MAPK-resistant Cdc25A mutant in an IL-7-dependent T-cell line as well as in peripheral, primary T-cells was sufficient to sustain cell survival and promote cell cycling for several days in the absence of IL7 (Khaled et al. 2005). Cdkn1b is a member of the CIP/KIP family of cyclin-dependent cell cycle inhibitors (CKIs) that negatively regulates the G1/S transition. In IL7 dependent T-cells, the expression of Cdkn1b was sufficient to cause G1 arrest in the presence of IL7. Withdrawal of IL7 induced the upregulation of Cdkn1b and arrested cells in G1 while siRNA knockout of Cdkn1b enhanced cell cycle progression. However, adoptive transfer of Cdkn1b-deficient lymphocytes into IL7 deficient mice indicated that loss of Cdkn1b could only partially compensate for the IL7 signal needed by T-cells to expand in a lymphopenic environment (Li et al. 2006), so though Cdkn1b may be involved in negative regulation of the cell cycle through an effect on cdk2 activity, its absence is not sufficient to fully induce cell cycling under lymphopenic conditions.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2675	Signaling by NODAL		Signaling by NODAL is essential for patterning of the axes of the embryo and formation of mesoderm and endoderm (reviewed in Schier 2009, Shen 2007). The NODAL proprotein is secreted and cleaved extracellularly to yield mature NODAL. Mature NODAL homodimerizes and can also form heterodimers with LEFTY1, LEFTY2, or CERBERUS, which negatively regulate NODAL signaling. NODAL also forms heterodimers with GDF1, which increases NODAL activity. NODAL dimers bind the NODAL receptor comprising a type I Activin receptor (ACVR1B or ACVR1C), a type II Activin receptor (ACVR2A or ACVR2B), and an EGF-CFC coreceptor (CRIPTO or CRYPTIC). After binding NODAL, the type II activin receptor phosphorylates the type I activin receptor which then phosphorylates SMAD2 and SMAD3 (R-SMADs). Phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3 form hetero-oligomeric complexes with SMAD4 (CO-SMAD) and transit from the cytosol to the nucleus. Within the nucleus the SMAD complexes interact with transcription factors such as FOXH1 to activate transcription of target genes.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2678	Prolactin receptor signaling		Prolactin (PRL) is a hormone secreted mainly by the anterior pituitary gland. It was originally identified by its ability to stimulate the development of the mammary gland and lactation, but is now known to have numerous and varied functions (Bole-Feysot et al. 1998). Despite this, few pathologies have been associated with abnormalities in prolactin receptor (PRLR) signaling, though roles in various forms of cancer and certain autoimmune disorders have been suggested (Goffin et al. 2002). A vast body of literature suggests effects of PRL in immune cells (Matera 1996) but PRLR KO mice have unaltered immune system development and function (Bouchard et al. 1999). In addition to the pituitary, numerous other tissues produce PRL, including the decidua and myometrium, certain cells of the immune system, brain, skin and exocrine glands such as the mammary, sweat and lacrimal glands (Ben-Jonathan et al. 1996). Pituitary PRL secretion is negatively regulated by inhibitory factors originating from the hypothalamus, the most important of which is dopamine, acting through the D2 subclass of dopamine receptors present in lactotrophs (Freeman et al. 2000). PRL-binding sites or receptors have been identified in numerous cells and tissues of adult mammals. Various forms of PRLR, generated by alternative splicing, have been reported in several species including humans (Kelly et al. 1991, Clevenger et al. 2003).<br><br>PRLR is a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily. Like many other members of this family, the first step in receptor activation was generally believed to be ligand-induced dimerization whereby one molecule of PRL bound to two molecules of receptor (Elkins et al. 2000). Recent reports suggest that PRLR pre-assembles at the plasma membrane in the absence of ligand (Gadd & Clevenger 2006, Tallet et al. 2011), suggesting that ligand-induced activation involves conformational changes in preformed PRLR dimers (Broutin et al. 2010). <br><br>PRLR has no intrinsic kinase activity but associates (Lebrun et al. 1994, 1995) with Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) which is activated following receptor activation (Campbell et al. 1994, Rui et al. 1994, Carter-Su et al. 2000, Barua et al. 2009). JAK2-dependent activation of JAK1 has also been reported (Neilson et al. 2007). It is generally accepted that activation of JAK2 occurs by transphosphorylation upon ligand-induced receptor activation, based on JAK activation by chimeric receptors in which various extracellular domains of cytokine or tyrosine kinase receptors were fused to the IL-2 receptor beta chain (see Ihle et al. 1994). This activation step involves the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, which in turn phosphorylates PRLR on specific intracellular tyrosine residues leading to STAT5 recruitment and signaling, considered to be the most important signaling cascade for PRLR. STAT1 and STAT3 activation have also been reported (DaSilva et al. 1996) as have many other signaling pathways; signaling through MAP kinases (Shc/SOS/Grb2/Ras/Raf/MAPK) has been reported as a consequence of PRL stimuilation in many different cellular systems (see Bole-Feysot et al. 1998) though it is not clear how this signal is propagated. Other cascades non exhaustively include Src kinases, Focal adhesion kinase, phospholipase C gamma, PI3 kinase/Akt and Nek3 (Clevenger et al. 2003, Miller et al. 2007). The protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 is recruited to the C terminal tyrosine of PRLR and may have a regulatory role (Ali & Ali 2000). PRLR phosphotyrosines can recruit insulin receptor substrates (IRS) and other adaptor proteins to the receptor complex (Bole-Feysot et al. 1998).<br><br>Female homozygous PRLR knockout mice are completely infertile and show a lack of mammary development (Ormandy et al. 1997). Hemizogotes are unable to lactate following their first pregnancy and depending on the genetic background, this phenotype can persist through subsequent pregnancies (Kelly et al. 2001).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2679	MHC class II antigen presentation		Antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as B cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes/macrophages express major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (MHC II) at their surface and present exogenous antigenic peptides to CD4+ T helper cells. CD4+ T cells play a central role in immune protection. On their activation they stimulate differentiation of B cells into antibody-producing B-cell blasts and initiate adaptive immune responses. MHC class II molecules are transmembrane glycoprotein heterodimers of alpha and beta subunits. Newly synthesized MHC II molecules present in the endoplasmic reticulum bind to a chaperone protein called invariant (Ii) chain. The binding of Ii prevents the premature binding of self antigens to the nascent MHC molecules in the ER and also guides MHC molecules to endocytic compartments. In the acidic endosomal environment, Ii is degraded in a stepwise manner, ultimately to free the class II peptide-binding groove for loading of antigenic peptides. Exogenous antigens are internalized by the APC by receptor mediated endocytosis, phagocytosis or pinocytosis into endocytic compartments of MHC class II positive cells, where engulfed antigens are degraded in a low pH environment by multiple acidic proteases, generating MHC class II epitopes. Antigenic peptides are then loaded into the class II ligand-binding groove. The resulting class II peptide complexes then move to the cell surface, where they are scanned by CD4+ T cells for specific recognition (Berger & Roche 2009, Zhou & Blum 2004, Watts 2004, Landsverk et al. 2009).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP268	Notch signaling		The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved, intercellular signaling mechanism essential for proper embryonic development in all metazoan organisms in the Animal kingdom. The Notch proteins (Notch1-Notch4 in vertebrates) are single-pass receptors that are activated by the Delta (or Delta-like) and Jagged/Serrate families of membrane-bound ligands. They are transported to the plasma membrane as cleaved, but otherwise intact polypeptides. Interaction with ligand leads to two additional proteolytic cleavages that liberate the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the plasma membrane. The NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with the DNA binding protein CSL, displacing a histone deacetylase (HDAc)-co-repressor (CoR) complex from CSL. Components of an activation complex, such as MAML1 and histone acetyltransferases (HATs), are recruited to the NICD-CSL complex, leading to the transcriptional activation of Notch target genes.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP268 CPTAC Assay Portal].		9606

CO2 bound as carbamate to the N-terminus of hemoglobin and protons (H+) bound to histidine residues in hemoglobin are released as hemoglobin (HbA) binds O2. Bicarbonate (HCO3-) present in plasma is taken up by erythrocytes via the band3 anion exchanger (AE1, SLC4A1) and combined with H+ by carbonic anhydrases I and II (CA1/CA2) to yield water and CO2 (Reviewed by Esbaugh and Tufts 2006). CO2 is passively transported out of the erythrocyte by AQP1 and RhAG. HCO3- in plasma is also directly dehydrated by extracellular carbonic anhydrase IV (CA4) present on endothelial cells lining the capillaries in the lung.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2683	Influenza Infection		For centuries influenza epidemics have plagued man; with influenza probably being the disease described by Hippocrates in 412 BC. Today it remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with large segments of the human population affected every year. Many animal species can be infected by influenza viruses, often with catastrophic consequences. An influenza pandemic is a continuing global level threat. The 1918 influenza pandemic is a modern example of how devastating such an event could be with an estimated 50 million deaths worldwide.<p>Influenza viruses belong to the family of Orthomyxoviridae; viruses with segmented RNA genomes that are negative sense and single-stranded (Baltimore 1971). Influenza virus strains are named according to their type (A, B, or C), the species from which the virus was isolated (omitted if human), location of isolate, the number of the isolate, the year of isolation, and in the case of influenza A viruses, the hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) subtype. For example, the virus of H5N1 subtype isolated from chickens in Hong Kong in 1997 is: influenza A/chicken/Hong Kong/220/97(H5N1) virus. Currently 16 different hemagglutinin (H1 to H16) subtypes and 9 different neuraminidase (N1 to N9) subtypes are known for influenza A viruses. Most human disease is due to influenza viruses of the A type. The events of influenza infection have been annotated in Reactome primarily use protein and genome references to the Influenza A virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 strain.The influenza virus particle initially associates with a human host cell by binding to sialic acid receptors on the host cell surface. Sialic acids are found on many vertebrate cells and numerous viruses make use of this ubiquitous receptor. The bound virus is endocytosed by one of four distinct mechanisms. Once endocytosed the low endosomal pH sets in motion a number of steps that lead to viral membrane fusion mediated by the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein, and the eventual release of the uncoated viral ribonucleoprotein complex into the cytosol of the host cell. The ribonucleoprotein complex is transported through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, the incoming negative-sense viral RNA (vRNA) is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) by a primer-dependent mechanism. Replication occurs via a two step process. A full-length complementary RNA (cRNA), a positive-sense copy of the vRNA, is first made and this in turn is used as a template to produce more vRNA. The viral proteins are expressed and processed and eventually assemble with vRNAs at what will become the budding sites on the host cell membrane. The viral protein and ribonucleoprotein complexes are assembled into complete viral particles and bud from the host cell, enveloped in the host cell's membrane.<p>Infection of a human host cell with influenza virus triggers an array of defensive host processes. This coevolution has driven the development of host processes that interfere with viral replication, notably the production of type I interferon. At the some time the virus counters these responses with the viral NS1 protein playing a central role in the viral response to the host cells defense.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2685	GABA synthesis, release, reuptake and degradation		GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. GABA modulates neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system. Disruption of GABA neurotransmission leads to many neurological diseases including epilepsy and a general anxiety disorder. GABA is synthesized by two distinct enzymes GAD67 and GAD65 that differ in their cellular localization, functional properties and co-factor requirements. GABA synthesized by GAD65 is used for neurotransmission whereas GABA synthesized by GAD67 is used for processes other than neurotransmission such as synaptogenesis and protection against neuronal injury. GABA is loaded into synaptic vesicle with the help of vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter or VGAT. GAD65 and VGAT are functionally linked at the synaptic vesicle membrane and GABA synthesized by GAD65 is preferentially loaded into the synaptic vesicle over GABA synthesized in cytoplasm by GAD67.The GABA loaded synaptic vesicles are docked at the plasma membrane with the help of the SNARE complexes and primed by interplay between various proteins including Munc18, complexin etc. Release of GABA loaded synaptic vesicle is initiated by the arrival of action potential at the presynaptic bouton and opening of N or P/Q voltage gated Ca2+ channels. Ca2+ influx results in Ca2+ binding by synaptobrevin, which is a part of the SNARE complex that also includes SNAP25 and syntaxin, leading to synaptic vesicle fusion. Release of GABA in the synaptic cleft leads to binding of GABA by the GABA receptors and post ligand binding events.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2686	Regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis by SREBP (SREBF)		Sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs, SREBFs) respond to low cholesterol concentrations by transiting to the nucleus and activating genes involved in cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis (reviewed in Brown and Goldstein 2009, Osborne and Espenshade 2009, Weber et al. 2004).<br> Newly synthesized SREBPs are transmembrane proteins that bind SCAP in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. SCAP binds cholesterol which causes a conformational change that allows SCAP to interact with INSIG, retaining the SCAP:SREBP complex in the ER. INSIG binds oxysterols, which cause INSIG to bind SCAP and retain SCAP:SREBP in the endoplasmic reticulum.<br>In low cholesterol (below about 5 mol%) SCAP no longer interacts with cholesterol or INSIG and binds Sec24 of the CopII coat complex instead. Thus SCAP:SREBP transits with the CopII complex from the ER to the Golgi. In the Golgi SREBP is cleaved by S1P and then by S2P, releasing the N-terminal fragment of SREBP into the cytosol. The N-terminal fragment is imported to the nucleus by importin-beta and then acts with other factors, such as SP1 and NF-Y, to activate transcription of target genes. Targets of SREBP include the genes encoding all enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis and several genes involved in lipogenesis. SREBP2 most strongly activates cholesterol biosynthesis while SREBP1C most strongly activates lipogenesis.

The sources of iron and sulfur are uncertain but the process requires a sulfur-containing compound exported from mitochondria via ABCB7 (ABC7).

It mediates signalling for multiple cell-surface receptors expressed by these cells, associating with receptor chains through complementary charged transmembrane amino acids that form a salt-bridge in the context of the hydrophobic lipid bilayer (Lanier et al. 1998). DAP12 homodimers associate with a variety of receptors expressed by macrophages, monocytes and myeloid cells including TREM2, Siglec H and SIRP-beta, as well as activating KIR, LY49 and the NKG2C proteins expressed by NK cells. DAP12 is expressed at the cell surface, with most of the protein lying on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (Turnbull & Colonna 2007, Tessarz & Cerwenka 2008).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2698	Meiotic recombination		Meiotic recombination exchanges segments of duplex DNA between chromosomal homologs, generating genetic diversity (reviewed in Handel and Schimenti 2010, Inagaki et al. 2010, Cohen et al. 2006). There are two forms of recombination: non-crossover (NCO) and crossover (CO). In mammals, the former is required for correct pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes, while CO intermediates called chiasmata are required for correct segregation of bivalents.<br>Meiotic recombination is initiated by double-strand breaks created by SPO11, which remains covalently attached to the 5' ends after cleavage. SPO11 is removed by cleavage of single DNA strands adjacent to the covalent linkage. The resulting 5' ends are further resected to produce protruding 3' ends. The single-stranded 3' ends are bound by RAD51 and DMC1, homologs of RecA that catalyze a search for homology between the bound single strand and duplex DNA of the chromosomal homolog. RAD51 and DMC1 then catalyze the invasion of the single strand into the homologous duplex and the formation of a D-loop heteroduplex. Approximately 90% of heteroduplexes are resolved without crossovers (NCO), probably by synthesis-dependent strand annealing.<br>The invasive strand is extended along the homolog and ligated back to its original duplex, creating a double Holliday junction. The mismatch repair proteins MSH4, MSH5 participate in this process, possibly by stabilizing the duplexes. The mismatch repair proteins MLH1 and MLH3 are then recruited to the double Holliday structure and an unidentified resolvase (Mus81? Gen1?) cleaves the junctions to yield a crossover. <br>Crossovers are not randomly distributed: The histone methyltransferase PRDM9 recruits the recombination machinery to genetically determined hotspots in the genome and each incipient crossover somehow inhibits formation of crossovers nearby, a phenomenon called crossover interference. Each chromosome bivalent, including the X-Y body in males, has at least one crossover and this is required for meiosis to proceed correctly.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2702	Mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis		Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins are localized in the cytosol, nucleus, and mitochondria of mammalian cells (reviewed in Stemmler et al. 2010, Rouault 2012, Bandyopadhyay et al. 2008, Lill 2009, Lill et al. 2012). Fe-S protein biogenesis in the mitochondrial matrix involves the iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly machinery. Ferrous iron is transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondrial matrix by Mitoferrin-1 (SLC25A37) and Mitoferrin-2 (SLC25A28). (Mitoferrin-1 is enriched in erythroid cells while Mitoferrin-2 is ubiquitous.) Frataxin binds ferrous iron in the mitochondrial matrix. The cysteine desulfurase NFS1 in a subcomplex with ISD11 provides the sulfur by converting cyteine into alanine and forming a persulfide which is used for cluster formation on ISCU, the scaffold protein. Interaction between NFS1 and ISD11 is necessary for desulfurase activity. Frataxin binds to a complex containing NFS1, ISD11, and ISCU and is proposed to function as an iron donor to ISCU or as an allosteric switch that activates sulfur transfer and Fe-S cluster assembly (Tsai and Barondeau 2010). Cluster formation also involves the electron transfer chain ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin. ISCU initially forms clusters containing 2 iron atoms and 2 sulfur atoms ([2Fe-2S] clusters). They are released by the function of HSP70-HSC20 chaperones and the monothiol glutaredoxin GLRX5 and used for assembly of [2Fe-2S] proteins. Assembly of larger clusters such as [4Fe-4S] clusters may involve the function of ISCA1, ISCA2, and IBA57. The clusters are transferred to apo-enzymes such as the respiratory complexes, aconitase, and lipoate synthase through dedicated targeting factors such as IND1, NFU1, and BOLA3.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2703	Extracellular matrix organization		The extracellular matrix is a component of all mammalian tissues, a network consisting largely of the fibrous proteins collagen, elastin and associated-microfibrils, fibronectin and laminins embedded in a viscoelastic gel of anionic proteoglycan polymers. It performs many functions in addition to its structural role; as a major component of the cellular microenvironment it influences cell behaviours such as proliferation, adhesion and migration, and regulates cell differentiation and death (Hynes 2009). <br><br>ECM composition is highly heterogeneous and dynamic, being constantly remodeled (Frantz et al. 2010) and modulated, largely by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and growth factors that bind to the ECM influencing the synthesis, crosslinking and degradation of ECM components (Hynes 2009). ECM remodeling is involved in the regulation of cell differentiation processes such as the establishment and maintenance of stem cell niches, branching morphogenesis, angiogenesis, bone remodeling, and wound repair. Redundant mechanisms modulate the expression and function of ECM modifying enzymes. Abnormal ECM dynamics can lead to deregulated cell proliferation and invasion, failure of cell death, and loss of cell differentiation, resulting in congenital defects and pathological processes including tissue fibrosis and cancer.<br><br>Collagen is the most abundant fibrous protein within the ECM constituting up to 30% of total protein in multicellular animals. Collagen provides tensile strength. It associates with elastic fibres, composed of elastin and fibrillin microfibrils, which give tissues the ability to recover after stretching. Other ECM proteins such as fibronectin, laminins, and matricellular proteins participate as connectors or linking proteins (Daley et al. 2008).<br><br>Chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate and keratan sulfate proteoglycans are structural components associated with collagen fibrils (Scott & Haigh 1985; Scott & Orford 1981), serving to tether the fibril to the surrounding matrix. Decorin belongs to the small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycan family (SLRPs) which also includes biglycan, fibromodulin, lumican and asporin. All appear to be involved in collagen fibril formation and matrix assembly (Ameye & Young 2002). <br><br>ECM proteins such as osteonectin (SPARC), osteopontin and thrombospondins -1 and -2, collectively referred to as matricellular proteins (reviewed in Mosher & Adams 2012) appear to modulate cell-matrix interactions. In general they induce de-adhesion, characterized by disruption of focal adhesions and a reorganization of actin stress fibers (Bornstein 2009).  Thrombospondin (TS)-1 and -2 bind MMP2. The resulting complex is endocytosed by the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), clearing MMP2 from the ECM (Yang et al. 2001).<br><br>Osteopontin (SPP1, bone sialoprotein-1) interacts with collagen and fibronectin (Mukherjee et al. 1995). It also contains several cell adhesive domains that interact with integrins and CD44.<br><br>Aggrecan is the predominant ECM proteoglycan in cartilage (Hardingham & Fosang 1992). Its relatives include versican, neurocan and brevican (Iozzo 1998). In articular cartilage the major non-fibrous macromolecules are aggrecan, hyaluronan and hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1 (HAPLN1). The high negative charge density of these molecules leads to the binding of large amounts of water (Bruckner 2006). Hyaluronan is bound by several large proteoglycans proteoglycans belonging to the hyalectan family that form high-molecular weight aggregates (Roughley 2006), accounting for the turgid nature of  cartilage. <br><br>The most significant enzymes in ECM remodeling are the Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP) and A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) families (Cawston & Young 2010). Other notable ECM degrading enzymes include plasmin and cathepsin G. Many ECM proteinases are initially present as precursors, activated by proteolytic processing. MMP precursors include an amino prodomain which masks the catalytic Zn-binding motif (Page-McCawet al. 2007). This can be removed by other proteinases, often other MMPs. ECM proteinases can be inactivated by degradation, or blocked by inhibitors. Some of these inhibitors, including alpha2-macroglobulin, alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, and alpha1-chymotrypsin can inhibit a large variety of proteinases (Woessner & Nagase 2000). The tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are potent MMP inhibitors (Brew & Nagase 2010). View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=1474244 Reactome].		9606

SREBPs alone are relatively weak activators of transcription, with SREBP1C being significantly weaker than SREBP1A or SREBP2. In combination with other transcription factors such as SP1 and NF-Y the SREBPs are much stronger activators.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2708	Collagen degradation		Collagen fibril diameter and spatial organisation are dependent on the species, tissue type and stage of development (Parry 1988). The lengths of collagen fibrils in mature tissues are largely unknown but in tendon can be measured in millimetres (Craig et al. 1989). Collagen fibrils isolated from adult bovine corneal stroma had ~350 collagen molecules in transverse section, tapering down to three molecules at the growing tip (Holmes & Kadler 2005). <br><br>The classical view of collagenases is that they actively unwind the triple helical chain, a process termed molecular tectonics (Overall 2002, Bode & Maskos 2003), before preferentially cleaving the alpha2 chain followed by the remaining chains (Chung et al. 2004). More recently it has been suggested that collagen fibrils exist in an equilibrium between protected and vulnerable states (Stultz 2002, Nerenberg & Stultz 2008). The prototypical triple-helical structure of collagen does not fit into the active site of collagenase MMPs. In addition the scissile bonds are not solvent-exposed and are therefore inaccessible to the collagenase active site (Chung et al. 2004, Stultz 2002). It was realized that collagen must locally unfold into non-triple helical regions to allow collagenolysis. Observations using circular dichroism and differential scanning calorimetry confirm that there is considerable heterogeneity along collagen fibres (Makareeva et al. 2008) allowing access for MMPs at physiological temperatures (Salsas-Escat et al. 2010).<br><br>Collagen fibrils with cut chains are unstable and accessible to proteinases that cannot cleave intact collagen strands (Woessner & Nagase 2000, Somerville et al. 2003). Continued degradation leads to the formation of gelatin (Lovejoy et al. 1999). Degradation of collagen types other than I-III is less well characterized but believed to occur in a similar manner. <br><br>Metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a major part in the degradation of several extracellular macromolecules including collagens. MMP1 (Welgus et al. 1981), MMP8 (Hasty et al. 1987), and MMP13 (Knauper et al. 1996), sometimes referred to as collagenases I, II and III respectively, are able to initiate the intrahelical cleavage of the major fibril forming collagens I, II and III at neutral pH, and thus thought to define the rate-limiting step in normal tissue remodeling events. All can cleave additional  substrates including other collagen subtypes. Collagenases cut collagen alpha chains at a single conserved Gly-Ile/Leu site approximately 3/4 of the molecule's length from the N-terminus (Fields 1991, Chung et al. 2004). The cleavage site is characterised by the motif  G(I/L)(A/L); the G-I/L bond is cleaved. In collagen type I this corresponds to G953-I954 in the Uniprot canonical alpha chain sequences (often given as G775-I776 in literature). It is not clear why only this bond is cleaved, as the motif occurs at several other places in the chain. MMP14, a membrane-associated MMP also known as Membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MT-MMP1), is able to cleave collagen types I, II and III (Ohuchi et al. 1997).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2709	Trafficking and processing of endosomal TLR		Mammalian TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9 are endosomal receptors that sense nucleic acids that have been released from endocytosed/phagocytosed bacteria, viruses or parasites. These TLRs have a ligand-recognition domain that faces the lumen of the endosome (which is topologically equivalent to the outside of the cell), a transmembrane domain, and a signaling domain that faces the cytosol.<p>Under normal conditions, self nucleic acids are not recognized by TLRs due to multiple levels of regulation including receptor compartmentalization, trafficking and proteolytic processing (Barton GM et al 2006, Ewald SE et al 2008). At steady state TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9 reside primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), however, their activation by specific ligands only occurs within acidified endolysosomal compartments (Hacker H et al 1998, Funami K et al 2004, Gibbard RJ et al 2006). Several chaperon proteins associate with TLRs in the ER to provide efficient translocation to endolysosome. Upon reaching endolysosomal compartments the ectodomains of TLR7 and TLR9 are proteolytically cleaved by cysteine endoproteases. Both full-length and cleaved C-terminus of TLR9 bind CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides, however it has been proposed that only the processed receptor is functional.<p> Although similar cleavage of TLR3 has been reported by Ewald et al 2011, other studies demonstrated that the N-terminal region of TLR3 ectodomain was implicated in ligand binding, thus TLR3 may function as a full-length receptor (Liu L et al 2008, Tokisue T et al 2008).<p> There are no data on TLR8 processing, although the cell biology of TLR8 is probably similar to TLR9 and TLR7 (Gibbard RJ et al 2006, Wei T et al 2009).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2710	Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD)		"The Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) pathway activates the destruction of mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs) (reviewed in Isken and Maquat 2007, Chang et al. 2007, Behm-Ansmant et al. 2007, Neu-Yilik and Kulozik 2008, Rebbapragada and Lykke-Andersen 2009, Bhuvanagiri et al. 2010, Nicholson et al. 2010, Durand and Lykke-Andersen 2011). In mammalian cells a termination codon can be recognized as premature if it precedes an exon-exon junction by at least 50-55 nucleotides or if it is followed by an abnormal 3' untranslated region (UTR). While length of the UTR may play a part, the qualifications for being ""abnormal"" have not been fully elucidated. Also, some termination codons preceding exon junctions are not degraded by NMD so the criteria for triggering NMD are not yet fully known (reviewed in Rebbapragada and Lykke-Andersen 2009). While about 30% of disease-associated mutations in humans activate NMD, about 10% of normal human transcripts are also degraded by NMD (reviewed in Stalder and Muhlemann 2008, Neu-Yilik and Kulozik 2008, Bhuvanagiri et al. 2010,  Nicholson et al. 2010). Thus NMD is a normal physiological process controlling mRNA stability in unmutated cells.<br>Exon junction complexes (EJCs) are deposited on an mRNA during splicing in the nucleus and are displaced by ribosomes during the first round of translation. When a ribosome terminates translation the A site encounters the termination codon and the eRF1 factor enters the empty A site and recruits eRF3. Normally, eRF1 cleaves the translated polypeptide from the tRNA in the P site and eRF3 interacts with Polyadenylate-binding protein (PABP) bound to the polyadenylated tail of the mRNA.<br>During activation of NMD eRF3 interacts with UPF1 which is contained in a complex with SMG1, SMG8, and SMG9. NMD can arbitrarily be divided into EJC-enhanced and EJC-independent pathways. In EJC-enhanced NMD, an exon junction is located downstream of the PTC and the EJC remains on the mRNA after termination of the pioneer round of translation. The core EJC is associated with UPF2 and UPF3, which interact with UPF1 and stimulate NMD. Once bound near the PTC, UPF1 is phosphorylated by SMG1. The phosphorylation is the rate-limiting step in NMD and causes UPF1 to recruit either SMG6, which is an endoribonuclease, or SMG5 and SMG7, which recruit ribonucleases. SMG6 and SMG5:SMG7 recruit phosphatase PP2A to dephosphorylate UPF1 and allow further rounds of degradation. How EJC-independent NMD is activated remains enigmatic but may involve competition between PABP and UPF1 for eRF3.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2712	Abacavir transport and metabolism		Abacavir is a nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor with antiretroviral activity, widely used in combination with other drugs to treat HIV-1 infection (Yuen et al. 2008). Its uptake across the plasma membrane is mediated by organic cation transporters SLC22A1, 2, and 3; the transport proteins ABCB1 and ABCG2 mediate its efflux. Abacavir itself is a prodrug. Activation requires phosphorylation by a cytosolic adenosine phosphotransferase and deamination by ADAL deaminase to yield carbovir monophosphate. Cytosolic nucleotide kinases convert carbovir monophosphate to carbovir triphosphate, the active HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Abacavir can be glucuronidated or oxidized to a 5'-carboxylate; these are the major forms in which it is excreted from the body.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2713	Signaling by SCF-KIT		Stem cell factor (SCF) is a growth factor with membrane bound and soluble forms. It is expressed by fibroblasts and endothelial cells throughout the body, promoting proliferation, migration, survival and differentiation of hematopoetic progenitors, melanocytes and germ cells.(Linnekin 1999, Ronnstrand 2004, Lennartsson and Ronnstrand 2006). The receptor for SCF is KIT, a tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK) closely related to the receptors for platelet derived growth factor receptor, colony stimulating factor 1 (Linnekin 1999) and Flt3 (Rosnet et al. 1991).  Four isoforms of c-Kit have been identified in humans. Alternative splicing results in isoforms of KIT differing in the presence or absence of four residues (GNNK) in the extracellular region. This occurs due to the use of an alternate 5' splice donor site. These GNNK+ and GNNK- variants are co-expressed in most tissues; the GNNK- form predominates and was more strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated and more rapidly internalized (Ronnstrand 2004). There are also splice variants that arise from alternative usage of splice acceptor site resulting in the presence or absence of a serine residue (Crosier et al., 1993). Finally, there is an alternative shorter transcript of KIT expressed in postmeiotic germ cells in the testis  which encodes a truncated KIT consisting only of the second part of the kinase domain and thus lackig the extracellular and transmembrane domains as well as the first part of the kinase domain (Rossi et al. 1991). Binding  of SCF homodimers to KIT results in KIT homodimerization followed by activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. KIT stimulation activates a wide array of signalling pathways including MAPK, PI3K and JAK/STAT (Reber et al. 2006, Ronnstrand 2004). Defects of KIT in humans are associated with different genetic diseases and also in several types of cancers like mast cell leukaemia, germ cell tumours, certain subtypes of malignant melanoma and gastrointestinal tumours.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2714	Signaling by Hippo		Human Hippo signaling is a network of reactions that regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis, centered on a three-step kinase cascade. The cascade was discovered by analysis of Drosophila mutations that lead to tissue overgrowth, and human homologues of its components have since been identified and characterized at a molecular level. Data from studies of mice carrying knockout mutant alleles of the genes as well as from studies of somatic mutations in these genes in human tumors are consistent with the conclusion that in mammals, as in flies, the Hippo cascade is required for normal regulation of cell proliferation and defects in the pathway are associated with cell overgrowth and tumorigenesis (Oh and Irvine 2010; Pan 2010; Zhao et al. 2010). This group of reactions is also notable for its abundance of protein:protein interactions mediated by WW domains and PPxY sequence motifs (Sudol and Harvey 2010).<p>There are two human homologues of each of the three Drosophila kinases, whose functions are well conserved: expression of human proteins rescues fly mutants. The two members of each pair of human homologues have biochemically indistinguishable functions. Autophosphorylated STK3 (MST2) and STK4 (MST1) (homologues of Drosophila Hippo) catalyze the phosphorylation and activation of LATS1 and LATS2 (homologues of Drosophila Warts) and of the accessory proteins MOB1A and MOB1B (homologues of Drosophila Mats). LATS1 and LATS2 in turn catalyze the phosphorylation of the transcriptional co-activators YAP1 and WWTR1 (TAZ) (homologues of Drosophila Yorkie).<p>In their unphosphorylated states, YAP1 and WWTR1 freely enter the nucleus and function as transcriptional co-activators. In their phosphorylated states, however, YAP1 and WWTR1 are instead bound by 14-3-3 proteins, YWHAB and YWHAE respectively, and sequestered in the cytosol.<p>Several accessory proteins are required for the three-step kinase cascade to function. STK3 (MST2) and STK4 (MST1) each form a complex with SAV1 (homologue of Drosophila Salvador), and LATS1 and LATS2 form complexes with MOB1A and MOB1B (homologues of Drosophila Mats).<p>In Drosophila a complex of three proteins, Kibra, Expanded, and Merlin, can trigger the Hippo cascade. A human homologue of Kibra, WWC1, has been identified and indirect evidence suggests that it can regulate the human Hippo pathway (Xiao et al. 2011). A molecular mechanism for this interaction has not yet been worked out and the molecular steps that trigger the Hippo kinase cascade in humans are unknown.<p>Four additional processes related to human Hippo signaling, although incompletely characterized, have been described in sufficient detail to allow their annotation. All are of physiological interest as they are likely to be parts of mechanisms by which Hippo signaling is modulated or functionally linked to other signaling processes. First, the caspase 3 protease cleaves STK3 (MST2) and STK4 (MST1), releasing inhibitory carboxyterminal domains in each case, leading to increased kinase activity and YAP1 / TAZ phosphorylation (Lee et al. 2001). Second, cytosolic AMOT (angiomotin) proteins can bind YAP1 and WWTR1 (TAZ) in their unphosphorylated states, a process that may provide a Hippo-independent mechanism to down-regulate the activities of these proteins (Chan et al. 2011). Third, WWTR1 (TAZ) and YAP1 bind ZO-1 and 2 proteins (Remue et al. 2010; Oka et al. 2010). Fourth, phosphorylated WWTR1 (TAZ) binds and sequesters DVL2, providing a molecular link between Hippo and Wnt signaling (Varelas et al. 2010).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2715	Metabolism of non-coding RNA		The term non-coding is commonly employed for RNA that does not encode a protein, but this does not mean that such RNAs do not contain information nor have function. There is considerable evidence that the majority of mammalian and other complex organism's genomes is transcribed into non-coding RNAs, many of which are alternatively spliced and/or processed into smaller products. Around 98% of all transcriptional output in humans is non-coding RNA. RNA-mediated gene regulation is widespread in higher eukaryotes and complex genetic phenomena like RNA interference are mediated by such RNAs.  These non-coding RNAs are a growing list and include rRNAs, tRNAs, snRNAs, snoRNAs siRNAs, 7SL RNA, 7SK RNA, the RNA component of RNase P RNA, the RNA component of RNase MRP, and the RNA component of telomerase.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2717	Mitochondrial protein import		A human mitochondrion contains about 1500 proteins, more than 99% of which are encoded in the nucleus, synthesized in the cytosol and imported into the mitochondrion. Proteins are targeted to four locations (outer membrane, intermembrane space, inner membrane, and matrix) and must be sorted accordingly (reviewed in Kutik et al. 2007, Milenkovic et al. 2007, Bolender et al. 2008, Endo and Yamano 2009, Wiedemann and Pfanner 2017, Kang et al. 2018). Newly synthesized proteins are transported from the cytosol across the outer membrane by the TOMM40:TOMM70 complex. Proteins that contain presequences first interact with the TOMM20 subunit of the complex while proteins that contain internal targeting elements first interact with the TOMM70 subunit. After initial interaction the protein is conducted across the outer membrane by TOMM40 subunits. In yeast some proteins such as Aco1, Atp1, Cit1, Idh1, and Atp2 have both presequences that interact with TOM20 and mature regions that interact with TOM70 (Yamamoto et al. 2009).<br>After passage across the outer membrane, proteins may be targeted to the outer membrane via the SAMM50 complex, to the inner membrane via the TIMM22 or TIMM23 complexes (reviewed in van der Laan et al. 2010), to the matrix via the TIMM23 complex (reviewed in van der Laan et al. 2010), or proteins may fold and remain in the intermembrane space (reviewed in Stojanovski et al. 2008, Deponte and Hell 2009,  Sideris and Tokatlidis 2010). Presequences on matrix and inner membrane proteins cause interaction with TIMM23 complexes; internal targeting sequences cause outer membrane proteins to interact with the SAMM50 complex and inner membrane proteins to interact with the TIMM22 complex. While in the intermembrane space hydrophobic proteins are chaperoned by the TIMM8:TIMM13 complex and/or the TIMM9:TIMM10:FXC1 complex.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2718	Signaling by NOTCH2		NOTCH2 is activated by binding Delta-like and Jagged ligands (DLL/JAG) expressed in trans on neighboring cells (Shimizu et al. 1999, Shimizu et al. 2000, Hicks et al. 2000, Ji et al. 2004). In trans ligand-receptor binding is followed by ADAM10 mediated (Gibb et al. 2010, Shimizu et al. 2000) and gamma secretase complex mediated cleavage of NOTCH2 (Saxena et al. 2001, De Strooper et al. 1999), resulting in the release of the intracellular domain of NOTCH2, NICD2, into the cytosol. NICD2 traffics to the nucleus where it acts as a transcriptional regulator. For a recent review of the cannonical NOTCH signaling, please refer to Kopan and Ilagan 2009, D'Souza et al. 2010, Kovall and Blacklow 2010. CNTN1 (contactin 1), a protein involved in oligodendrocyte maturation (Hu et al. 2003) and MDK (midkine) (Huang et al. 2008, Gungor et al. 2011), which plays an important role in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, can also bind NOTCH2 and activate NOTCH2 signaling.<br><br>In the nucleus, NICD2 forms a complex with RBPJ (CBF1, CSL) and MAML (mastermind). The NICD2:RBPJ:MAML complex activates transcription from RBPJ binding promoter elements (RBEs) (Wu et al. 2000). NOTCH2 coactivator complexes directly stimulate transcription of HES1 and HES5 genes (Shimizu et al. 2002), both of which are known NOTCH1 targets. NOTCH2 but not NOTCH1 coactivator complexes, stimulate FCER2 transcription. Overexpression of FCER2 (CD23A) is a hallmark of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and correlates with the malfunction of apoptosis, which is thought be an underlying mechanism of B-CLL development (Hubmann et al. 2002). NOTCH2 coactivator complexes together with CREBP1 and EP300 stimulate transcription of GZMB (granzyme B), which is important for the cytotoxic function of CD8+ T cells (Maekawa et al. 2008).<br><br>NOTCH2 gene expression is differentially regulated during human B-cell development, with NOTCH2 transcripts appearing at late developmental stages (Bertrand et al. 2000).<br><br> NOTCH2 mutations are a rare cause of Alagille syndrome (AGS). AGS is a dominant congenital multisystem disorder characterized mainly by hepatic bile duct abnormalities. Craniofacial, heart and kidney abnormalities are also frequently observed in the Alagille spectrum (Alagille et al. 1975). AGS is predominantly caused by mutations in JAG1, a NOTCH2 ligand (Oda et al. 1997, Li et al. 1997), but it can also be caused by mutations in NOTCH2 (McDaniell et al. 2006).<br><br><br>Hajdu-Cheney syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by severe and progressive bone loss, is caused by NOTCH2 mutations that result in premature C-terminal NOTCH2 truncation, probably leading to increased NOTCH2 signaling (Simpson et al. 2011, Isidor et al. 2011, Majewski et al. 2011).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2719	Fcgamma receptor (FCGR) dependent phagocytosis		Phagocytosis is one of the important innate immune responses that function to eliminate invading infectious agents. Monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils are the professional phagocytic cells. Phagocytosis is a complex process involving the recognition of invading foreign particles by specific types of phagocytic receptors and the subsequent internalization of the particles. Fc gamma receptors (FCGRs) are among the best studied phagocytic receptors that bind to Fc portion of immunoglobulin G (IgG). Through their antigen binding F(ab) end, antibodies bind to specific antigen while their constant (Fc) region binds to FCGRs on phagocytes. The clustering of FCGRs by IgG antibodies on the phagocyte initiates a variety of signals, which lead, through the reorganisation of actin cytoskeleton and membrane remodelling, to the formation of pseudopod and phagosome. Fc gamma receptors are classified into three classes: FCGRI, FCGRII and FCGRIII. Each class of these FCGRs consists of several individual isoforms. Among all these isoforms FCGRI, FCGRIIA and FCGRIIIA, are able to mediate phagocytosis (Joshi et al. 2006, Garcia Garcia & Rosales 2002, Nimmerjahn & Ravetch 2006).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2721	Signaling by NOTCH4		The NOTCH4 gene locus was discovered as a frequent site of insertion for the proviral genome of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) (Gallahan and Callahan 1987). MMTV-insertion results in aberrant expression of the mouse mammary tumor gene int-3, which was subsequently discovered to represent the intracellular domain of Notch4 (Robbins et al. 1992, Uyttendaele et al. 1996).<br><br>NOTCH4 is prevalently expressed in endothelial cells (Uyttendaele et al. 1996). DLL4 and JAG1 act as ligands for NOTCH4 in human endothelial cells (Shawber et al. 2003, Shawber et al. 2007), but DLL4- and JAG1-mediated activation of NOTCH4 have not been confirmed in all cell types tested (Aste-Amezaga et al. 2010, James et al. 2014). The gamma secretase complex cleaves activated NOTCH4 receptor to release the intracellular domain fragment (NICD4) (Saxena et al. 2001, Das et al. 2004). NICD4 traffics to the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor and stimulates expression of NOTCH target genes HES1, HES5, HEY1 and HEY2, as well as VEGFR3 and ACTA2 (Lin et al. 2002, Raafat et al.2004, Tsunematsu et al. 2004, Shawber et al. 2007, Tang et al. 2008, Bargo et al. 2010). NOTCH4 signaling can be downregulated by AKT1 phosphorylation-induced cytoplasmic retention (Ramakrishnan et al. 2015) as well as proteasome-dependent degradation upon FBXW7-mediated ubiquitination (Wu et al. 2001, Tsunematsu et al. 2004).<br><br>NOTCH4 was reported to inhibit NOTCH1 signaling in-cis, by binding to NOTCH1 and interfering with the S1 cleavage of NOTCH1, thus preventing production of functional NOTCH1 heterodimers at the cell surface (James et al. 2014).<br><br>NOTCH4 is involved in development of the vascular system. Overexpression of constitutively active Notch4 in mouse embryonic vasculature results in abnormal vessel structure and patterning (Uyttendaele et al. 2001). NOTCH4 may act to inhibit apoptosis of endothelial cells (MacKenzie et al. 2004).<br><br>Expression of int-3 interferes with normal mammary gland development in mice and promotes tumorigenesis. The phenotype of mice expressing int-3 in mammary glands is dependent on the presence of Rbpj (Raafat et al. 2009). JAG1 and NOTCH4 are upregulated in human ER+ breast cancers resistant to anti-estrogen therapy, which correlates with elevated expression of NOTCH target genes HES1, HEY1 and HEY2,  and is associated with increased population of breast cancer stem cells and distant metastases (Simoes et al. 2015). Development of int-3-induced mammary tumours  in mice depends on Kit and Pdgfra signaling (Raafat et al. 2006) and on int-3-induced activaton of NFKB signaling (Raafat et al. 2017). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), high NOTCH4 expression correlates with elevated HEY1 levels, increased cell proliferation and survival, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and cisplatin resistance (Fukusumi et al. 2018). In melanoma, however, exogenous NOTCH4 expression correlates with mesenchymal-to-epithelial-like transition and reduced invasiveness (Bonyadi Rad et al. 2016). NOTCH4 is frequently overexpressed in gastric cancer. Increased NOTCH4 levels correlate with activation of WNT signaling and gastric cancer progression (Qian et al. 2015).<br><br>NOTCH4 is expressed in adipocytes and may promote adipocyte differentiation (Lai et al. 2013).<br><br>During Dengue virus infection, DLL1, DLL4, NOTCH4 and HES1 are upregulated in interferon-beta (INFB) dependent manner (Li et al. 2015). NOTCH4 signaling may be affected by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, as the EBV protein BARF0 binds to NOTCH4 (Kusano and Raab-Traub 2001).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2722	Signaling by NOTCH3		Similar to NOTCH1, NOTCH3 is activated by delta-like and jagged ligands (DLL/JAG) expressed in trans on a neighboring cell. The activation triggers cleavage of NOTCH3, first by ADAM10 at the S2 cleavage site, then by gamma-secretase at the S3 cleavage site, resulting in the release of the intracellular domain of NOTCH3, NICD3, into the cytosol. NICD3 subsequently traffics to the nucleus where it acts as a transcriptional regulator. NOTCH3 expression pattern is more restricted than the expression patterns of NOTCH1 and NOTCH2, with predominant expression of NOTCH3 in vascular smooth muscle cells, lymphocytes and the nervous system (reviewed by Bellavia et al. 2008). Based on the study of Notch3 knockout mice, Notch3 is not essential for embryonic development or fertility (Krebs et al. 2003).<p><p>Germline gain-of-function NOTCH3 mutations are an underlying cause of the CADASIL syndrome - cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy. CADASIL is characterized by degeneration and loss of vascular smooth muscle cells from the arterial wall, predisposing affected individuals to an early onset stroke (Storkebaum et al. 2011). NOTCH3 promotes survival of vascular smooth muscle cells at least in part by induction of CFLAR (c FLIP), an inhibitor of FASLG activated death receptor signaling. The mechanism of NOTCH3 mediated upregulation of CFLAR is unknown; it is independent of the NOTCH3 coactivator complex and involves an unelucidated crosstalk with the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway (Wang et al. 2002).<p><p>In rat brain, NOTCH3 and NOTCH1 are expressed at sites of adult neurogenesis, such as the dentate gyrus (Irvin et al. 2001). NOTCH3, similar to NOTCH1, promotes differentiation of the rat adult hippocampus derived multipotent neuronal progenitors into astroglia (Tanigaki et al. 2001). NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3, and their ligand DLL1 are expressed in neuroepithelial precursor cells in the neural tube of mouse embryos. Together, they signal to inhibit neuronal differentiation of neuroepithelial precursors. Expression of NOTCH3 in mouse neuroepithelial precursors is stimulated by growth factors BMP2, FGF2, Xenopus TGF beta5 - homologous to TGFB1, LIF, and NTF3 (Faux et al. 2001).<p>In mouse telencephalon, NOTCH3, similar to NOTCH1, promotes radial glia and neuronal progenitor phenotype. This can, at least in part be attributed to NOTCH mediated activation of RBPJ-dependent and HES5-dependent transcription (Dang et al. 2006).<p>In mouse spinal cord, Notch3 is involved in neuronal differentiation and maturation. Notch3 knockout mice have a decreased number of mature inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord, which may be involved in chronic pain conditions (Rusanescu and Mao 2014).<p><p>NOTCH3 amplification was reported in breast cancer, where NOTCH3 promotes proliferation and survival of ERBB2 negative breast cancer cells (Yamaguchi et al. 2008), and it has also been reported in ovarian cancer (Park et al. 2006). NOTCH3 signaling is involved in TGF beta (TGFB1) signaling-induced eptihelial to mesenchimal transition (EMT) (Ohashi et al. 2011, Liu et al. 2014)<p><p>NOTCH3 indirectly promotes development of regulatory T cells (Tregs). NOTCH3 signaling activates pre-TCR-dependent and PKC-theta (PRKCQ)-dependent NF-kappaB (NFKB) activation, resulting in induction of FOXP3 expression (Barbarulo et al. 2011). Deregulated NOTCH3 and pre-TCR signaling contributes to development of leukemia and lymphoma (Bellavia et al. 2000, Bellavia et al. 2002).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2724	Alpha-linolenic (omega-3) and linoleic (omega-6) acid metabolism		There are two major classes of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs): the omega-3 (n-3) and the omega-6 (n-6) fatty acids, where the number corresponds to the position of the first double bond proximate to the methyl end of the fatty acid. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are considered essential fatty acids. Humans cannot synthesize them, instead they are supplied through diet. Linoleic acid (LA, 18:2(n-6)), a major component of omega-6 fatty acids and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:2(n-3)) a major component of omega-3 fatty acids are the two main dietary essential fatty acids (EFAs) in humans. ALA and LA obtained from diet are converted in the body into their longer chain and more unsaturated omega-3 and omega-6 products by a series of desaturation and elongation steps. Metabolism of ALA and LA to their corresponding products is mediated via common enzyme systems. In humans ALA is finally converted to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6(n-3)), and LA is converted to docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, C22:5(n-6)). The intermediary omega-3 and omega-6 series fatty acids play a significant role in health and disease by generating potent modulatory molecules for inflammatory responses, including eicosanoids (prostaglandins, and leukotrienes), and cytokines (interleukins) and affecting the gene expression of various bioactive molecules (Kapoor & Huang 2006, Sprecher 2002, Burdge 2006).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2725	Collagen biosynthesis and modifying enzymes		The biosynthesis of collagen is a multistep process. Collagen propeptides are cotranslationally translocated into the ER lumen. Propeptides undergo a number of post-translational modifications. Proline and lysine residues may be hydroxylated by prolyl 3-, prolyl 4- and lysyl hydroxylases. 4-hydroxyproline is essential for intramolecular hydrogen bonding and stability of the triple helical collagenous domain. In fibril forming collagens approximately 50% of prolines are 4-hydroxylated; the extent of this and of 3-hydroxyproline and lysine hydroxylation varies between tissues and collagen types (Kivirikko et al. 1972, 1992). Hydroxylysine molecules can form cross-links between collagen molecules in fibrils, and are sites for glycosyl- and galactosylation. Collagen peptides all have non-collagenous domains; collagens within the subclasses have common chain structures. These non-collagenous domains have regulatory functions; some are biologically active when cleaved from the main peptide chain. Fibrillar collagens all have a large triple helical domain (COL1) bordered by N and C terminal extensions, called the N and C propeptides, which are cleaved prior to formation of the collagen fibril. The C propeptide, also called the NC1 domain, is highly conserved. It directs chain association during intracellular assembly of the procollagen molecule from three collagen propeptide alpha chains (Hulmes 2002). The N-propeptide has a short linker (NC2) connecting the main triple helix to a short minor one (COL2) and a globular N-terminal region NC3. NC3 domains are variable both in size and the domains they contain.<br><br>Collagen propeptides typically undergo a number of post-translational modifications. Proline and lysine residues are hydroxylated by prolyl 3-, prolyl 4- and lysyl hydroxylases. 4-hydroxyproline is essential for intramolecular hydrogen bonding and stability of the triple helical collagenous domain. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase may also have a role in alpha chain association as no association of the C-propeptides of type XII collagen was seen in the presence of prolyl 4-hydroxylase inhibitors (Mazzorana et al. 1993, 1996). In fibril forming collagens approximately 50% of prolines are 4-hydroxylated; the extent of this is species dependent, lower hydroxylation correlating with lower ambient temperature and thermal stability (Cohen-Solal et al. 1986, Notbohm et al. 1992). Similarly the extent of 3-hydroxyproline and lysine hydroxylation varies between tissues and collagen types (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Hydroxylysine molecules can form cross-links between collagen molecules in fibrils, and are sites for glycosyl- and galactosylation.<br><br>Collagen molecules fold and assemble through a series of distinct intermediates (Bulleid 1996). Individual collagen polypeptide chains are translocated co-translationally across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Intra-chain disulfide bonds are formed within the N-propeptide, and hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues occurs within the triple helical domain (Kivirikko et al. 1992). When the peptide chain is fully translocated into the ER lumen the C-propeptide folds, the conformation being stabilized by intra-chain disulfide bonds (Doege and Fessler 1986). Pro alpha-chains associate via the C-propeptides (Byers et al. 1975, Bachinger et al. 1978), or NC2 domains for FACIT family collagens (Boudko et al. 2008) to form an initial trimer which can be stabilized by the formation of inter-chain disulfide bonds (Schofield et al. 1974, Olsen et al. 1976), though these are not a prerequisite for further folding (Bulleid et al. 1996). The triple helix then nucleates and folds in a C- to N- direction. The association of the individual chains and subsequent triple helix formation are distinct steps (Bachinger et al. 1980). The N-propeptides associate and in some cases form inter-chain disulfide bonds (Bruckner et al., 1978). Procollagen is released via carriers into the exracellular space (Canty & Kadler 2005). Fibrillar procollagens undergo removal of the C- and N-propeptides by procollagen C and N proteinases respectively, both Zn2+ dependent metalloproteinases. Propeptide processing is a required step for normal collagen I and III fibril formation, but collagens can retain some or all of their non-collagenous propeptides. Retained collagen type V and XI N-propeptides contribute to the control of fibril growth by sterically limiting lateral molecule addition (Fichard et al. 1995). Processed fibrillar procollagen is termed tropocollagen, which is considered to be the unit of higher order fibrils and fibres. Tropocollagens of the fibril forming collagens I, II, III, V and XI sponteneously aggregate in vitro in a manner that has been compared with crystallization, commencing with a nucleation event followed by subsequent organized aggregation (Silver et al. 1992, Prockop & Fertala 1998). Fibril formation is stabilized by lysyl oxidase catalyzed crosslinks between adjacent molecules (Siegel &  Fu 1976).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2727	Cellular response to hypoxia		Oxygen plays a central role in the functioning of human cells: it is both essential for normal metabolism and toxic. Here we have annotated one aspect of cellular responses to oxygen, the role of hypoxia-inducible factor in regulating cellular transcriptional responses to changes in oxygen availability.<p>In the presence of oxygen members of the transcription factor family HIF-alpha, comprising HIF1A, HIF2A (EPAS1), and HIF3A, are hydroxylated on proline residues by PHD1 (EGLN2), PHD2 (EGLN1), and PHD3 (EGLN3) and on asparagine residues by HIF1AN (FIH) (reviewed in Pouyssegur et al. 2006, Semenza 2007, Kaelin and Ratcliffe 2008, Nizet and Johnson 2009, Brahimi-Horn and Pouyssegur 2009, Majmundar et al. 2010, Loenarz and Schofield 2011). Both types of reaction require molecular oxygen as a substrate and it is probable that at least some HIF-alpha molecules carry both hydroxylated asparagine and hydroxylated proline (Tian et al. 2011).<br>Hydroxylated asparagine interferes with the ability of HIF-alpha to interact with p300 and CBP while hydroxylated proline facilitates the interaction of HIF-alpha with the E3 ubiquitin ligase VHL, causing ubiquitination and proteolysis of HIF-alpha. Hypoxia inhibits both types of hydroxylation, resulting in the stabilization of HIF-alpha, which then enters the nucleus, binds HIF-beta, and recruits p300 and CBP to activate target genes such as EPO and VEGF.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2728	Incretin synthesis, secretion, and inactivation		Incretins are peptide hormones produced by the gut that enhance the ability of glucose to stimulate insulin secretion from beta cells in the pancreas. Two incretins have been identified: Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) and Glucose-dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide (GIP, initially named Gastric Inhibitory Peptide). Both are released by cells of the small intestine, GLP-1 from L cells and GIP from K cells.<br>The control of incretin secretion is complex. Fatty acids, phospholipids, glucose, acetylcholine, leptin, and Gastrin-releasing Peptide all stimulate secretion of GLP-1. Fatty acids and phospholipids are the primary stimulants of secretion of GIP in humans (carbohydrates have more effect in rodents).<br>Incretins secreted into the bloodstream are subject to rapid inactivation by Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV (DPP IV), which confers half-lives of only a few minutes onto GLP-1 and GIP. Inhibitors of DPP IV, for example sitagliptin, are now being used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2729	Metabolism of angiotensinogen to angiotensins		Angiotensinogen, a prohormone, is synthesized and secreted mainly by the liver but also from other tissues (reviewed in Fyhrquist and Saijonmaa 2008, Cat and Touyz 2011). Renin, an aspartyl protease specific for angiotensinogen, is secreted into the bloodstream by juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney in response to a drop in blood pressure. Renin cleaves angiotensinogen to yield a decapaptide, angiotensin I (angiotensin-1, angiotensin-(1-10)). Circulating renin can also bind the membrane-localized (pro)renin receptor (ATP6AP2) which increases its catalytic activity. After cleavage of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I by renin, two C-terminal amino acid residues of angiotensin I are removed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), located on the surface of endothelial cells, to yield angiotensin II (angiotensin-2, angiotensin-(1-8)), the active peptide that causes vasoconstriction, resorption of sodium and chloride, excretion of potassium, water retention, and aldosterone secretion.<br>More recently other, more tissue-localized pathways leading to angiotensin II and alternative derivatives of angiotensinogen have been identified (reviewed in Kramkowski et al. 2006, Kumar et al. 2007, Fyhrquist and Saijonmaa 2008, Becari et al. 2011). Chymase, cathepsin G, and cathepsin X (cathepsin Z) can each cleave angiotensin I to yield angiotensin II. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cleaves 1 amino acid residue from angiotensin I (angiotensin-(1-10)) to yield angiotensin-(1-9), which can be cleaved by ACE to yield angiotensin-(1-7). ACE2 can also cleave angiotensin II to yield angiotensin-(1-7). Neprilysin can cleave either angiotensin-(1-9) or angiotensin I to yield angiotensin-(1-7). Angiotensin-(1-7) binds the MAS receptor (MAS1, MAS proto-oncogene) and, interestingly, produces effects opposite to those produced by angiotensin II.<br>Aminopeptidase A (APA, ENPEP) cleaves angiotensin II to yield angiotensin III (angiotensin-(2-8)), which is then cleaved by aminopeptidase N (APN, ANPEP) yielding angiotensin IV (angiotensin-(3-8)). Angiotensin IV binds the AT4 receptor (AT4R, IRAP, LNPEP, oxytocinase).<br>Inhibitors of renin (e.g. aliskiren) and ACE (e.g. lisinopril, ramipril) are currently used to treat hypertension (reviewed in Gerc et al. 2009, Verdecchia et al. 2010,  Alreja and Joseph 2011).

First, short segments of axial elements form along chromosomes. Telomeres then cluster at a region of the inner nuclear membrane and axial elements extend and fuse along the length of the chromosomes. Subsequent to the initiation of recombination transverse filaments of SYCP1 link axial/lateral elements to a central element containing SYCE1 and SYCE2, thus forming the synaptonemal complex (reviewed in Yang and Wang 2009).<br>Unsynapsed regions are silenced during pachynema by recruitment of BRCA1 and ATR, which phosphorylates histone H2AX (reviewed in Inagaki et al. 2010).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2735	RAF/MAP kinase cascade		The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway regulates processes such as proliferation, differentiation, survival, senescence and cell motility in response to growth factors, hormones and cytokines, among others. Binding of these stimuli to receptors in the plasma membrane promotes the GEF-mediated activation of RAS at the plasma membrane and initiates the three-tiered kinase cascade of the conventional MAPK cascades.  GTP-bound RAS recruits RAF (the MAPK kinase kinase), and promotes its dimerization and activation (reviewed in Cseh et al, 2014; Roskoski, 2010; McKay and Morrison, 2007; Wellbrock et al, 2004).  Activated RAF phosphorylates the MAPK kinase proteins MEK1 and MEK2 (also known as MAP2K1 and MAP2K2), which in turn phophorylate the proline-directed kinases ERK1 and 2 (also known as MAPK3 and MAPK1) (reviewed in Roskoski, 2012a, b; Kryiakis and Avruch, 2012).  Activated ERK proteins may undergo dimerization and have identified targets in both the nucleus and the cytosol; consistent with this, a proportion of activated ERK protein relocalizes to the nucleus in response to stimuli (reviewed in Roskoski 2012b; Turjanski et al, 2007; Plotnikov et al, 2010; Cargnello et al, 2011).  Although initially seen as a linear cascade originating at the plasma membrane and culminating in the nucleus, the RAS/RAF MAPK cascade is now also known to be activated from various intracellular location.  Temporal and spatial specificity of the cascade is achieved in part through the interaction of pathway components with numerous scaffolding proteins (reviewed in McKay and Morrison, 2007; Brown and Sacks, 2009). <br> The importance of the RAS/RAF MAPK cascade is highlighted by the fact that components of this pathway are mutated with high frequency in a large number of human cancers.  Activating mutations in RAS are found in approximately one third of human cancers, while ~8% of tumors express an activated form of BRAF (Roberts and Der, 2007; Davies et al, 2002; Cantwell-Dorris et al, 2011).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2736	Insulin processing		The generation of insulin-containing secretory granules from proinsulin in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can be described in 4 steps: formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds, formation of proinsulin-zinc-calcium complexes, proteolytic cleavage of proinsulin to yield insulin, translocation of the granules across the cytosol to the plasma membrane.<br>Transcription of the human insulin gene INS is activated by 4 important transcription factors: Pdx-1, MafA, Beta2/NeuroD1, and E47. The transcription factors interact with each other at the promoters of the insulin gene and act synergistically to promote transcription. Expression of the transcription factors is upregulated in response to glucose.<br>The preproinsulin mRNA is translated by ribosomes at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the preproinsulin enters the secretion pathway by virtue of its signal peptide, which is cleaved during translation to yield proinsulin. Evidence indicates that the preproinsulin mRNA is stabilized by glucose.<br>In the process annotated in detail here, within the ER, three intramolecular disulfide bonds form between cysteine residues in the proinsulin. Formation of the bonds is the spontaneous result of the conformation of proinsulin and the oxidizing environment of the ER, which is maintained by Ero1-like alpha<br>The cystine bonded proinsulin then moves via vesicles from the ER to the Golgi Complex. High concentrations of zinc are maintained in the Golgi by zinc transporters ZnT5, ZnT6, and ZnT7 and the proinsulin forms complexes with zinc and calcium.<br>Proinsulin-zinc-calcium complexes bud in vesicles from the trans-Golgi to form immature secretory vesicles (secretory granules) in the cytosol. Within the immature granules the endoproteases Prohormone Convertase 1/3 and Prohormone Convertase 2 cleave at two sites of the proinsulin and Carboxypeptidase E removes a further 4 amino acid residues to yield the cystine-bonded A and B chains of mature insulin and the C peptide, which will also be secreted with the insulin. The insulin-zinc-calcium complexes form insoluble crystals within the granule<br>The insulin-containing secretory granules are then translocated across the cytosol to the inner surface of the plasma membrane. Translocation occurs initially by attachment of the granules to Kinesin-1, which motors along microtubules, and then by attachment to Myosin Va, which motors along the microfilaments of the cortical actin network.<br>A pancreatic beta cell contains about 10000 insulin granules of which about 1000 are docked at the plasma membrane and 50 are readily releasable in immediate response to stimulation by glucose or other secretogogues. Docking is due to interaction between the Exocyst proteins EXOC3 on the granule membrane and EXOC4 on the plasma membrane. Exocytosis is accomplished by interaction between SNARE-type proteins Syntaxin 1A and Syntaxin 4 on the plasma membrane and Synaptobrevin-2/VAMP2 on the granule membrane. Exocytosis is a calcium-dependent process due to interaction of the calcium-binding membrane protein Synaptotagmin V/IX with the SNARE-type proteins.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2737	SRP-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane		The process for translation of a protein destined for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) branches from the canonical cytoslic translation process at the point when a nascent polypeptide containing a hydrophobic signal sequence is exposed on the surface of the cytosolic ribosome:mRNA:peptide complex. The signal sequence mediates the interaction of this complex with a cytosolic signal recognition particle (SRP) to form a complex which in turn docks with an SRP receptor complex on the ER membrane. There the ribosome complex is transferred from the SRP complex to a translocon complex embedded in the ER membrane and reoriented so that the nascent polypeptide protrudes through a pore in the translocon into the ER lumen. Translation, which had been halted by SRP binding, now resumes, the signal peptide is cleaved from the polypeptide, and elongation proceeds, with the growing polypeptide oriented into the ER lumen.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2740	Glycerophospholipid biosynthesis		Glycerophospholipids are important structural and functional components of biological membranes and constituents of serum lipoproteins and the pulmonary surfactant.  In addition, glycerophospholipids act as precursors of lipid mediators such as platelet-activating factor and eicosanoids.  Cellular membranes contains a distinct composition of various glycerophospholipids such as phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylinositol (PI), cardiolipin (CL), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and lysobisphosphatidic acid (also known as bis(monoacylglycerol) hydrogen phosphate - BMP).<br><br>Glycerophospholipids are first formed by the <i>de novo</i> (Kennedy) pathway using fatty acids activated as acyl-CoA donors.  However, the acyl groups of glycerophospholipids are highly diverse and distributed in an asymmetric manner.  Saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids are usually esterified at the <i>sn-1</i> position, whereas polyunsaturated acyl groups are esterified at the <i>sn-2</i> position.  Subsequent acyl chain remodeling (Lands cycle) generates the diverse glycerophospholipid composition and asymmetry characteristic of cell membranes.<br><br>In the <i>de novo</i> pathway of glycerophospholipid biosynthesis, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is initially formed from glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P).  Next, LPA is converted to PA by a LPA acyltransferase (AGPAT, also known as LPAAT), then PA is metabolized into two types of glycerol derivatives.  The first is diacylglycerol (DAG) which is converted to triacylglycerol (TAG), PC, and PE.  Subsequently, PS is synthesized from PC or PE.  The second is cytidine diphosphate-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG), which is processed into PI, PG, CL, and BMP.  Each glycerophospholipid is involved in acyl chain remodeling via cleavage by phospholipases followed by reacylation by an acyltransferase.<br><br>Most of the glycerophospholipids are synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), however, some, most notably cardiolipin, and BMP are synthesized in the mitochondrial and endosomal membranes respectively.  Since the most of the glycerophospholipids are found in all membrane compartments, there must be extensive network of transport of glycerophospholipids from one membrane compartment to another via various mechanisms including diffusion through the cytosol, formation of transportation complexes, and diffusion via membrane contact sites (MCS) (Osman et al. 2011, Lebiedzinska et al. 2009, Lev 2010, Scherer & Schmitz 2011, Orso et al. 2011, Hermansson et al. 2011, Vance & Vance 2008).

Mono-, di-, and triphosphorylation of the inositol ring generates a wide variety of stereochemically distinct signalling entities.  Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (I(1,4,5)P3), is formed when the phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) is hydrolysed by a phospholipase C isozyme.  An array of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and tetrakisphosphate (IP4) molecules are synthesised by the action of various kinases and phosphatases in the cytosol.  These species then transport between the cytosol and the nucleus where they are acted on by inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK), inositol-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (IPPK), inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1) and 2 (IP6K2), to produce IP5, IP6, IP7, and IP8 molecules.  Some of these nuclear produced IPs transport back to the cytosol where they are converted to an even wider variety of IPs, by kinases and phosphatases, including the di- and triphospho inositol phosphates aka pyrophosphates (Irvine & Schell 2001, Bunney & Katan 2010, Alcazar-Romain & Wente 2008, York 2006, Monserrate and York 2010).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2742	Signaling by TGF-beta Receptor Complex		The TGF-beta/BMP pathway incorporates several signaling pathways that share most, but not all, components of a central signal transduction engine. The general signaling scheme is rather simple: upon binding of a ligand, an activated plasma membrane receptor complex is formed, which passes on the signal towards the nucleus through a phosphorylated receptor SMAD (R-SMAD). In the nucleus, the activated R-SMAD promotes transcription in complex with a closely related helper molecule termed Co-SMAD (SMAD4). However, this simple linear pathway expands into a network when various regulatory components and mechanisms are taken into account. The signaling pathway includes a great variety of different TGF-beta/BMP superfamily ligands and receptors, several types of the R-SMADs, and functionally critical negative feedback loops. The R-SMAD:Co-SMAD complex can interact with a great number of transcriptional co-activators/co-repressors to regulate positively or negatively effector genes, so that the interpretation of a signal depends on the cell-type and cross talk with other signaling pathways such as Notch, MAPK and Wnt. The pathway plays a number of different biological roles in the control of embryonic and adult cell proliferation and differentiation, and it is implicated in a great number of human diseases.<br>TGF beta (TGFB1) is secreted as a homodimer, and as such it binds to TGF beta receptor II (TGFBR2), inducing its dimerization. Binding of TGF beta enables TGFBR2 to form a stable hetero-tetrameric complex with TGF beta receptor I homodimer (TGFBR1). TGFBR2 acts as a serine/threonine kinase and phosphorylates serine and threonine residues within the short GS domain (glycine-serine rich domain) of TGFBR1.<br>The phosphorylated heterotetrameric TGF beta receptor complex (TGFBR) internalizes into clathrin coated endocytic vesicles where it associates with the endosomal membrane protein SARA. SARA facilitates the recruitment of cytosolic SMAD2 and SMAD3, which act as R-SMADs for TGF beta receptor complex. TGFBR1 phosphorylates recruited SMAD2 and SMAD3, inducing a conformational change that promotes formation of R-SMAD trimers and dissociation of R-SMADs from the TGF beta receptor complex. <br>In the cytosol, phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3 associate with SMAD4 (known as Co-SMAD), forming a heterotrimer which is more stable than the R-SMAD homotrimers. R-SMAD:Co-SMAD heterotrimer translocates to the nucleus where it directly binds DNA and, in cooperation with other transcription factors, regulates expression of genes involved in cell differentiation, in a context-dependent manner. <br>The intracellular level of SMAD2 and SMAD3 is regulated by SMURF ubiquitin ligases, which target R-SMADs for degradation. In addition, nuclear R-SMAD:Co-SMAD heterotrimer stimulates transcription of inhibitory SMADs (I-SMADs), forming a negative feedback loop. I-SMADs bind the phosphorylated TGF beta receptor complexes on caveolin coated vesicles, derived from the lipid rafts, and recruit SMURF ubiquitin ligases to TGF beta receptors, leading to ubiquitination and degradation of TGFBR1. Nuclear R-SMAD:Co-SMAD heterotrimers are targets of nuclear ubiquitin ligases which ubiquitinate SMAD2/3 and SMAD4, causing heterotrimer dissociation, translocation of ubiquitinated SMADs to the cytosol and their proteasome-mediated degradation.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2743	Glycosaminoglycan metabolism		Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are long, unbranched polysaccharides containing a repeating disaccharide unit composed of a hexosamine (either N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) or N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)) and a uronic acid (glucuronate or iduronate). They can be heavily sulfated. GAGs are located primarily in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and on cell membranes, acting as a lubricating fluid for joints and as part of signalling processes. They have structural roles in connective tissue, cartilage, bone and blood vessels (Esko et al. 2009). GAGs are degraded in the lysosome as part of their natural turnover. Defects in the lysosomal enzymes responsible for the metabolism of membrane-associated GAGs lead to lysosomal storage diseases called mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS). MPSs are characterised by the accumulation of GAGs in lysosomes resulting in chronic, progressively debilitating disorders that in many instances lead to severe psychomotor retardation and premature death (Cantz & Gehler 1976, Clarke 2008). The biosynthesis and breakdown of the main GAGs (hyaluronate, keratan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate) is described here.

Plasma CO2 is also taken up by erythrocytes via AQP1 and RhAG. Within erythrocytes CA1 and, predominantly, CA2 hydrate CO2 to HCO3- and protons (reviewed in Geers & Gros 2000, Jensen 2004, Boron 2010).

Binding of antigen to the immunoglobulin activates phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in the cytoplasmic tails of Ig-alpha and Ig-beta by Src family tyrosine kinases, including LYN, FYN, and BLK (Nel et al. 1984, Yamanashi et al. 1991, Flaswinkel and Reth 1994, Saouaf et al. 1994, Hata et al. 1994, Saouaf et al. 1995, reviewed in Gauld and Cambier 2004, reviewed in Harwood and Batista 2010).<br>The protein kinase SYK binds the phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-activated motifs (ITAMs) on the cytoplasmic tails of Ig-alpha (CD79A, MB-1) and Ig-beta (CD79B, B29) (Wienands et al. 1995, Rowley et al. 1995, Tsang et al. 2008). The binding causes the activation and autophosphorylation of SYK (Law et al. 1994, Baldock et al. 2000, Irish et al. 2006, Tsang et al. 2008, reviewed in Bradshaw 2010).<br>Activated SYK and other kinases phosphorylate BLNK (SLP-65), BCAP, and CD19 which serve as scaffolds for the assembly of large complexes, the signalosomes, by recruiting phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phospholipase C gamma (predominantly PLC-gamma2 in B cells, Coggeshall et al. 1992), NCK, BAM32, BTK, VAV1, and SHC. The effectors are phosphorylated by SYK and other kinases.<br>PLC-gamma associated with BLNK hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to yield inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (Carter et al. 1991, Kim et al. 2004). IP3 binds receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum and causes release of calcium ions from the ER into the cytosol. The depletion of calcium from the ER in turn activates STIM1 to interact with ORAI and TRPC1 channels in the plasma membrane, resulting in an influx of extracellular calcium ions (Muik et al. 2008, Luik et al. 2008, Park et al. 2009, Mori et al. 2002). PI3K associated with BCAP and CD19 phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to yield phosphatidyinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate.<br>Second messengers (calcium, diacylglycerol,  inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate) trigger signaling pathways: NF-kappaB is activated via protein kinase C beta, RAS is activated via RasGRP proteins, NF-AT is activated via calcineurin, and AKT (PKB) is activated via PDK1 (reviewed in Shinohara and Kurosaki 2009, Stone 2006).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2747	PI Metabolism		Phosphatidylinositol (PI), a membrane phospholipid, can be reversibly phosphorylated at the 3, 4, and 5 positions of the inositol ring to generate seven phosphoinositides: phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI5P), phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate PI(3,4)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate PI(3,5)P2, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3). These seven phosphoinositides, which are heterogeneously distributed within cells, can serve as signature components of different intracellular compartment membranes and so help to mediate specificity of membrane interactions. Phosphoinositide levels are tightly regulated spatially and temporally by the action of various kinases and phosphatases whilst PI(4,5)P2 is also a substrate for phospholipase C. The differential localisation of each of these enzymes on specific compartment membranes ensures maintenance of the heterogeneous distribution of phosphoinositides despite the continuous membrane flow from one compartment to another.<br><br>PI is primarily synthesised in the endoplasmic reticulum from where the phospholipid is exported to other compartments via membrane traffic or via cytosolic phospholipid transfer proteins. Phosphorylation of PI to PI4P primarily occurs in the Golgi, where PI4P plays an important role in the biogenesis of transport vesicles such as the secretory vesicle involved in its transport to the plasma membrane. At this place, PI4P has a major function acting as a precursor of PI(4,5)P2, which is located predominantly at this membrane. PI(4,5)P2 binds and regulates a wide range of proteins that function on the cell surface and serves as a precursor for second messengers. Additionally, it helps define this membrane as a target for secretory vesicles, functions as a coreceptor in endocytic processes, and functions as a cofactor for actin nucleation.<br><br>At the plasma membrane, PI(4,5)P2 is further phosphorylated to PI(3,4,5)P3, another phosphoinositide with important signalling functions including stimulating cell survival and proliferation. The inositol 3-phosphatase, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) regenerates PI(4,5)P2, while the 5-phosphatases convert PI(3,4,5)P3 into the phosphoinositide, PI(3,4)P2, propagating the signal initiated by PI(3,4,5)P3. PI(3,4)P2 is further dephosphorylated in the endocytic pathway by inositol 4-phosphatases to PI3P, the signature phosphoinositide of the early endosomal compartment and a ligand for numerous endosomal proteins. However, the bulk of PI3P is generated directly in the endosomes by phosphorylation of PI. The subsequent endosomal phosphorylation of PI3P to PI(3,5)P2 is believed to generate docking sites for recruitment of cytosolic factors responsible for the control of outgoing traffic from the endosomes. The main localisation and function of the low abundance phosphoinositide PI5P, that can be generated by several pathways, remains to be determined (Krauss & Haucke 2007, Leventis & Grinstein 2010, Roth 2004, Gees et al. 2010, De Matteis & Godi 2004, van Meer et al. 2008, Vicinanza et al. 2008, Lemmon 2008, Kutaleladze 2010, Robinson & Dixon 2006, Blero et al. 2007, Liu & Bankaitis 2010, McCrea & De Camilli 2009, Vicinanza et al. 2008, Di Paolo & De Camilli, 2006).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2749	Metabolism of steroid hormones		Steroid hormones are synthesized primarily in the adrenal gland and gonads. They regulate energy metabolism and stress responses (glucocorticoids), salt balance (mineralocorticoids), and sexual development and function (androgens and estrogens). All steroids are synthesized from cholesterol. Steroid hormone synthesis is largely regulated at the initial steps of cholesterol mobilization and transport into the mitochondrial matrix for conversion to pregnenolone. In the body, the fate of pregnenolone is tissue-specific: in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex it is converted to cortisol, in the zona glomerulosa to aldosterone, and in the gonads to testosterone and then to estrone and estradiol. These pathways are outlined in the figure below, which also details the sites on the cholesterol molecule that undergo modification in the course of these reactions.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2751	Transcriptional regulation of white adipocyte differentiation		Adipogenesis is the process of cell differentiation by which preadipocytes become adipocytes. During this process the preadipocytes cease to proliferate, begin to accumulate lipid droplets and develop morphologic and biochemical characteristics of mature adipocytes such as hormone responsive lipogenenic and lipolytic programs. The most intensively studied model system for adipogenesis is differentiation of the mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line by an induction cocktail of containing mitogens (insulin/IGF1), glucocorticoid (dexamethasone), an inducer of cAMP (IBMX), and fetal serum (Cao et al. 1991, reviewed in Farmer 2006). More recently additional cellular models have become available to study adipogenesis that involve almost all stages of development (reviewed in Rosen and MacDougald 2006). In vivo knockout mice lacking putative adipogenic factors have also been extensively studied. Human pathways are traditionally inferred from those discovered in mouse but are now beginning to be validated in cellular models derived from human adipose progenitors (Fischer-Posovszky et al. 2008, Wdziekonski et al. 2011).<br>Adipogenesis is controlled by a cascade of transcription factors (Yeh et al. 1995, reviewed in Farmer 2006, Gesta et al. 2007). One of the first observable events during adipocyte differentiation is a transient increase in expression of the CEBPB (CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein Beta, C/EBPB) and CEBPD (C/EBPD) transcription factors (Cao et al. 1991, reviewed in Lane et al. 1999). This occurs prior to the accumulation of lipid droplets. However, it is the subsequent inductions of CEBPA and PPARG that are critical for morphological, biochemical and functional adipocytes.<br>Ectopic expression of CEBPB alone is capable of inducing substantial adipocyte differentiation in fibroblasts while CEBPD has a minimal effect. CEBPB is upregulated in response to intracellular cAMP (possibly via pCREB) and serum mitogens (possibly via Krox20). CEBPD is upregulated in response to glucocorticoids. The exact mechanisms that upregulate the CEBPs are not fully known.<br>CEBPB and CEBPD act directly on the Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor Gamma (PPARG) gene by binding its promoter and activating transcription. CEBPB and CEBPD also directly activate the EBF1 gene (and possibly other EBFs) and KLF5 (Jimenez et al. 2007, Oishi 2005). The EBF1 and KLF5 proteins, in turn bind, and activate the PPARG promoter. Other hormones, such as insulin, affect PPARG expression and other transcription factors, such as ADD1/SREBP1c, bind the PPARG promoter. This is an area of ongoing research.<br>During adipogenesis the PPARG gene is transcribed to yield 2 variants. The adipogenic variant 2 mRNA encodes 30 additional amino acids at the N-terminus compared to the widely expressed variant 1 mRNA.<br>PPARG encodes a type II nuclear hormone receptor (remains in the nucleus in the absence of ligand) that forms a heterodimer with the Retinoid X Receptor Alpha (RXRA). The heterodimer was initially identified as a complex regulating the aP2/FABP4 gene and named ARF6 (Tontonoz et al. 1994).<br>The PPARG:RXRA heterodimer binds a recognition sequence that consists of two hexanucleotide motifs (DR1 motifs) separated by 1 nucleotide. Binding occurs even in the absence of ligands, such as fatty acids, that activate PPARG. In the absence of activating ligands, the PPARG:RXRA complex recruits repressors of transcription such as SMRT/NCoR2, NCoR1, and HDAC3 (Tontonoz and Spiegelman 2008).<br>Each molecule of PPARG can bind 2 molecules of activating ligands. Although, the identity of the endogenous ligands of PPARG is unknown, exogenous activators include fatty acids and the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic drugs (reviewed in Berger et al. 2005, Heikkinen et al. 2007, Lemberger et al. 1996). The most potent activators of PPARG in vitro are oxidized derivatives of unsaturated fatty acids.. Upon binding activating ligands PPARG causes a rearrangement of adjacent factors: Corepressors such as SMRT/NCoR2 are lost and coactivators such as TIF2, PRIP, CBP, and p300 are recruited (Tontonoz and Spiegelman). PPARG also binds directly to the TRAP220 subunit of the TRAP/Mediator complex that recruits RNA polymerase II. Thus binding of activating ligand by PPARG causes transcription of PPARG target genes.<br>Targets of PPARG include genes involved in differentiation (PGAR/HFARP, Perilipin, aP2/FABP4, CEBPA), fatty acid transport (LPL, FAT/CD36), carbohydrate metabolism (PEPCK-C, AQP7, GK, GLUT4 (SLC2A4)), and energy homeostasis (LEPTIN and ADIPONECTIN) (Perera et al. 2006).<br>Within 10 days of differentiation CEBPB and CEBPD are no longer located at the PPARG promoter. Instead CEBPA is present. EBF1 and PPARG bind the CEBPA promoter and activate transcription of CEBPA, one of the key transcription factors in adipogenesis. A current hypothesis posits a self-reinforcing loop that maintains PPARG expression and the differentiated state: PPARG activates CEBPA and CEBPA activates PPARG. Additionally EBF1 (and possibly other EBFs) activates CEBPA, CEBPA activates EBF1, and EBF1 activates PPARG.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2752	MyD88-independent TLR4 cascade 		MyD88-independent signaling pathway is shared by TLR3 and TLR4 cascades. TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-beta (TRIF or TICAM1) is a key adapter molecule in transducing signals from TLR3 and TLR4 in a MyD88-independent manner (Yamamoto M et al. 2003a). TRIF is recruited to ligand-stimulated TLR3 or 4 complex via its TIR domain. TLR3 directly binds TRIF (Oshiumi H et al 2003). In contrast, TLR4-mediated signaling pathway requires two adapter molecules, TRAM (TRIF-related adapter molecule or TICAM2) and TRIF. TRAM(TICAM2) is thought to bridge between the activated TLR4 complex and TRIF (Yamamoto M et al. 2003b, Tanimura N et al. 2008, Kagan LC et al. 2008).<p>TRIF recruitment to TLR complex stimulates distinct pathways leading to production of type 1 interferons (IFNs), pro-inflammatory cytokines and induction of programmed cell death.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2759	Fc epsilon receptor (FCERI) signaling		Mast cells (MC) are distributed in tissues throughout the human body and have long been recognized as key cells of type I hypersensitivity reactions. They also play important roles in inflammatory and immediate allergic reactions. Activation through FCERI-bound antigen-specific IgE causes release of potent inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, proteases, chemotactic factors, cytokines and metabolites of arachidonic acid that act on the vasculature, smooth muscle, connective tissue, mucous glands and inflammatory cells (Borish & Joseph 1992, Amin 2012, Metcalfe et al. 1993). FCERI is a multimeric cell-surface receptor that binds the Fc fragment of IgE with high affinity. On mast cells and basophils FCERI exists as a tetrameric complex consisting of one alpha-chain, one beta-chain, and two disulfide-bonded gamma-chains, and on dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, macrophages, and eosinophils it exists as a trimeric complex with one alpha-chain and two disulfide-bonded gamma-chains (Wu 2011, Kraft & Kinet 2007). FCERI signaling in mast cells includes a network of signaling molecules and adaptor proteins. These molecules coordinate ultimately leading to effects on degranulation, eicosanoid production, and cytokine and chemokine production and cell migration and adhesion, growth and survival.<br>The first step in FCERI signaling is the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the ITAM of both the beta and the gamma subunits of the FCERI by LYN, which is bound to the FCERI beta-chain. The phosphorylated ITAM then recruits the protein tyrosine kinase SYK (spleen tyrosine kinase) which then phosphorylates the adaptor protein LAT. Phosphorylated LAT (linker for activation of T cells) acts as a scaffolding protein and recruits other cytosolic adaptor molecules GRB2 (growth-factor-receptor-bound protein 2), GADS (GRB2-related adaptor protein), SHC (SRC homology 2 (SH2)-domain-containing transforming protein C) and SLP76 (SH2-domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa), as well as the exchange factors and adaptor molecules VAV and SOS (son of sevenless homologue), and the signalling enzyme phospholipase C gamma1 (PLC-gamma1). Tyrosoine phosphorylation of enzymes and adaptors, including VAV, SHC GRB2 and SOS stimulate small GTPases such as RAC, RAS and RAF. These pathways lead to activation of the ERK, JNK and p38 MAP kinases, histamine release and cytokine production. FCERI activation also triggers the phosphorylation of PLC-gamma which upon membrane localisation hydrolyse PIP2 to form IP3 and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) - second messengers that release Ca2+ from internal stores and activate PKC, respectively. Degranulation or histamine release follows the activation of PLC-gamma and protein kinase C (PKC) and the increased mobilization of calcium (Ca2+). Receptor aggregation also results in the phosphorylation of adaptor protein NTAL/LAT2 which then recruits GAB2. PI3K associates with phosphorylated GAB2 and catalyses the formation of PIP3 in the membrane, which attracts many PH domain proteins like BTK, PLC-gamma, AKT and PDK. PI3K mediated activation of AKT then regulate the mast cell proliferation, development and survival (Gu et al. 2001).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2760	Signaling by BMP		Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have many biological activities in various tissues, including bone, cartilage, blood vessels, heart, kidney, neurons, liver and lung. They are members of the Transforming growth factor-Beta (TGFB) family. They bind to type II and type I serine-threonine kinase receptors, which transduce signals through SMAD and non-SMAD signalling pathways. BMP signalling is linked to a wide variety of clinical disorders, including vascular diseases, skeletal diseases and cancer. BMPs typically activate BMP type I receptors and signal via SMAD1, 5 and 8. They can be classified into several subgroups, including the BMP2/4 group, the BMP5-8 osteogenic protein-1 (OP1) group, the growth and differentiation factor (GDF) 5-7 group and the BMP9/10 group. Most of the proteins of the BMP2/4, OP1 and BMP9/10 groups induce formation of bone and cartilage tissues in vivo, while the GDF5-7 group induce cartilage and tendon-like, but not bone-like, tissues (Miyazono et al. 2010). Members of the TGFB family bind to two types of serine-threonine kinase receptors, type I and type II (MassaguÃ© 2012). BMPs can bind type I receptors in the absence of type II receptors, but both types are required for signal transduction. The presence of both types dramatically increases binding affinity (Rozenweig et al. 1995). The type II receptor kinase transphosphorylates the type I receptor, which transmits specific intracellular signals. Type I and type II receptors share similar structural properties, comprised of a relatively short extracellular domain, a single membrane-spanning domain and an intracellular domain containing a serine-threonine kinase domain. Seven receptors, collectively referred to as the Activin receptor-like kinases (ALK), have been identified as type I receptors for the TGFB family in mammals. ALKs are classified into three groups based on their structure and function, the BMPRI group (Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-1A, ALK3, BMPR1A and Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-1B, ALK6, BMPR1B), the ALK1 group (Serine/threonine-protein kinase receptor R3, ALK1, ACVRL1 and Activin receptor type-1, ALK2, ACVR1) and the TBetaR1 group (Activin receptor type-1B, ALK4, ACVR1B and  TGF-beta receptor type-1, ALK5, TGFBR1 and Activin receptor type-1C, ALK7, ACVR1C) (Kawabata et al. 1998). ALK1 group and BMPRI group activate SMAD1/5/8 and transduce similar intracellular signals. The TBetaR1 group activate SMAD2/3. BMPR1A and ACVR1 are widely expressed. BMPR1B shows a more restricted expression profile. ACVRL1 is limited to endothelial cells and a few other cell types. The binding specificities of BMPs to type I receptors is affected by the type II receptors that are present (Yu et al. 2005). Typically, BMP2 and BMP4 bind to BMPR1A and BMPR1B (ten Dijke et al. 1994). BMP6 and BMP7 bind strongly to ACVR1 and weakly to BMPR1B. Growth/differentiation factor 5 (BMP14, GDF5) preferentially binds to BMPR1B, but not to other type I receptors (Nishitoh et al. 1995). BMP9 and BMP10 bind to ACVRL1 and ACVRL (Scharpfenecker et al. 2007). BMP type I receptors are shared by other members of the TGFB family. Three receptors, Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-2 (BMPR2), Activin receptor type-2A (ACVR2A) and Activin receptor type-2B (ACVR2B) are the type II receptors for mammalian BMPs. They are widely expressed in various tissues. BMPR2 is specific for BMPs, whereas ACVR2A and ACVR2B are shared with activins and myostatin. BMP binding and signalling can be affected by coreceptors. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins of the repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) family, including RGMA, RGMB (DRAGON) and Hemojuvelin (HFE2, RGMC) are coreceptors for BMP2 and BMP4, enhancing signaling (Samad et al. 2005, Babitt et al. 2005, 2006). They interact with BMP type I and/or type II receptors and bind BMP2 and BMP4, but not BMP7 or TGFB1. BMP2/4 signalling normally involves BMPR2, not ACVR2A or ACVR2B. Cells transfected with RGMA use both BMPR2 and ACVR2A for BMP-2/4 signalling, suggesting that RGMA facilitates the use of ACVR2A by BMP2/4 (Xia et al. 2007). Endoglin (ENG) is a transmembrane protein expressed in proliferating endothelial cells. It binds various ligands including TGFB1/3, Activin-A and BMP2/7 (Barbara et al. 1999). It inhibits TGFB-induced responses and enhances BMP7-induced responses (Scherner et al. 2007). Mutations in ENG result in hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT1), also known as OslerWeberRendu disease, while mutations in ACVRL1 lead to HHT2, suggesting that they act in a common signalling pathway (McAllister et al. 1994, Johnson et al. 1996). BMP2 is a dimeric protein, having two receptor-binding motifs. One is a high-affinity binding site for BMPR1A, the other is a low-affinity binding site for BMPR2 (Kirsch et al. 2000). In the absence of ligand stimulation, small fractions of type II and type I receptors are present as preexisting homodimers and heterodimers on the cell surface. Ligand-binding increases oligomerization. The intracellular domains of type I receptors have a characteristic GS domain (glycine and serine-rich domain) located N-terminal to the serine-threonine kinase domains. Type II receptor kinases are constitutively active in the absence of ligand. Upon ligand binding, the type II receptor kinase phosphorylates the GS domain of the type I receptor, a critical event in signal transduction by the serine/threonine kinase receptors (Miyazono et al. 2010). Activation of the TGFBR1 receptor has been studied in detail. The inactive conformation is maintained by interaction between the GS domain, the N-terminal lobe and the activation loop of the kinase (Huse et al. 1999). When the GS domain is phosphorylated by the type II receptor kinase, the TGFBR1 kinase is converted to an active conformation. Mutations of Thr-204 in TGFBR1 and the corresponding Gln in BMP type I receptors lead to their constitutive activation. The L45 loop, in the kinase domain of  type I receptors, specifically interacts with receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads). Neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 3 (NT-3 growth factor receptor, TrkC, NTRK3) directly binds BMPR2, interfereing with its interaction with BMPR1A, which inhibits downstream signalling (Jin et al. 2007). Tyrosine-protein kinase transmembrane receptor ROR2 and BMPR1B form a heteromeric complex in a ligand independent fashion that modulatesGDF5-BMPR1B signalling by inhibition of Smad1/5 signalling (Sammar et al. 2004). Type I receptor kinases activated by the type II receptor kinases, phosphorylate R-Smads. R-Smads then form a complex with common-partner Smad (co-Smad) and translocate to the nucleus. The oligomeric Smad complexes regulate the transcription of target genes through interaction with various transcription factors and transcriptional coactivators or corepressors. Inhibitory Smads (I-Smads) negatively regulate the action of R-Smads and/or co-Smads. Eight different Smads have been identified in mammals. Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8 are R-Smads in BMP signalling pathways (BMP-specific R-Smads). Smad2 and Smad3 are R-Smads in TGFB/activin<br>signalling pathways. BMP receptors can phosphorylate Smad2 in certain types of cells (Murakami et al. 2009). Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8 are structurally highly similar to each other. The functional differences between them are largely unknown. Smad4 is the only co-Smad in mammals, shared by both BMP and TGFB/activin signalling pathways. Smad6 and Smad7 are I-Smads.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2761	MyD88:MAL(TIRAP) cascade initiated on plasma membrane		The first known downstream component of TLR4 and TLR2 signaling is the adaptor MyD88. Another adapter MyD88-adaptor-like (Mal; also known as TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein or TIRAP) has also been described for TLR4 and TLR2 signaling. MyD88 comprises an N-terminal Death Domain (DD) and a C-terminal TIR, whereas Mal lacks the DD. The TIR homotypic interactions bring adapters into contact with the activated TLRs, whereas the DD modules recruit serine/threonine kinases such as interleukin-1-receptor-associated kinase (IRAK). Recruitment of these protein kinases is accompanied by phosphorylation, which in turn results in the interaction of IRAKs with TNF-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). The oligomerization of TRAF6 activates TAK1, a member of the MAP3-kinase family, and this leads to the activation of the IkB kinases. These kinases, in turn, phosphorylate IkB, leading to its proteolytic degradation and the translocation of NF-kB to the nucleus. Concomitantly, members of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor family, Jun and Fos, are activated, and both AP-1 transcription factors and NF-kB are required for cytokine production, which in turn produces downstream inflammatory effects.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2763	Nucleotide-binding domain, leucine rich repeat containing receptor (NLR) signaling pathways		The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading microorganisms, a broad specificity response characterized by the recruitment and activation of phagocytes and the release of anti-bacterial peptides. The receptors involved recognize conserved molecules present in microbes called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and/or molecules that are produced as a result of tissue injury, the damage associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs). PAMPs are essential to the pathogen and therefore unlikely to vary. Examples are lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycans (PGNs) and viral RNA. DAMPs include intracellular proteins, such as heat-shock proteins and extracellular matrix proteins released by tissue injury, such as hyaluronan fragments. Non-protein DAMPs include ATP, uric acid, heparin sulfate and dsDNA. The receptors for these factors are referred to collectively as pathogen- or pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). The best studied of these are the membrane-associated Toll-like receptor family. Less well studied but more numerous are the intracellular nucleotide-binding domain, leucine rich repeat containing receptors (NLRs) also called nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, a family with over 20 members in humans and over 30 in mice. These recognise PAMPs/DAMPs from phagocytosed microorganisms or from intracellular infections (Kobayashi et al. 2003, Proell et al. 2008, Wilmanski et al. 2008). Some NLRs are involved in process unrelated to pathogen detection such as tissue homeostasis, apoptosis, graft-versus-host disease and early development (Kufer & Sansonetti 2011). <br><br><br>Structurally NLRs can be subdivided into the caspase-recruitment domain (CARD)-containing NLRCs (NODs) and the pyrin domain (PYD)-containing NLRPs (NALPs), plus outliers including ice protease (caspase-1) activating factor (IPAF) (Martinon & Tschopp, 2005). In practical terms, NLRs can be divided into the relatively well characterized NOD1/2 which signal via RIP2 primarily to NFkappaB, and the remainder, some of which participate in macromolecular structures called Inflammasomes that activate caspases. Mutations in several members of the NLR protein family have been linked to inflammatory diseases, suggesting these molecules play important roles in maintaining host-pathogen interactions and inflammatory responses.<br><br><br>Most NLRs have a tripartite structure consisting of a variable amino-terminal domain, a central nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD or NACHT) that is believed to mediate the formation of self oligomers, and a carboxy-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) that detects PAMPs/DAMPs. In most cases the amino-terminal domain includes protein-interaction modules, such as CARD or PYD, some harbour baculovirus inhibitor repeat (BIR) or other domains. For most characterised NLRs these domains have been attributed to downstream signaling<br><br>Under resting conditions, NLRs are thought to be present  in an autorepressed form, with the LRR folded back onto the NACHT domain preventing oligomerization. Accessory proteins may help maintain the inactive state. PAMP/DAMP exposure is thought to triggers conformational changes that expose the NACHT domain enabling oligomerization and recruitment of effectors, though it should be noted that due to the lack of availability of structural data, the mechanistic details of NLR activation remain largely elusive.<br><br>New terminology for NOD-like receptors was adopted by the Human Genome Organization (HUGO) in 2008 to standardize the nomenclature of NLRs. The acronym NLR, once standing for NOD-like receptor, now is an abbreviation of 'nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat containing' protein. The term NOD-like receptor is officially outdated and replaced by NLRC where the C refers to the CARD domain. However the official gene symbols for NOD1 and NOD2 still contain NOD and this general term is still widely used.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2769	Activation of Matrix Metalloproteinases		The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), previously known as matrixins, are classically known to be involved in the turnover of extracellular matrix (ECM) components. However, recent high throughput proteomics analyses have revealed that ~80% of MMP substrates are non-ECM proteins including cytokines, growth factor binding proteins, and receptors. It is now clear that MMPs regulate ECM turnover not only by cleaving ECM components, but also by the regulation of cell signaling, and that some MMPs are beneficial and may be drug anti-targets. Thus, MMPs have important roles in many processes including embryo development, morphogenesis, tissue homeostasis and remodeling. They are implicated in several diseases such as arthritis, periodontitis, glomerulonephritis, atherosclerosis, tissue ulceration, and cancer cell invasion and metastasis. All MMPs are synthesized as preproenzymes. Alternate splice forms are known, leading to nuclear localization of select MMPs. Most are secreted from the cell, or in the case of membrane type (MT) MMPs become plasma membrane associated, as  inactive proenzymes. Their subsequent activation is a key regulatory step, with requirements specific to MMP subtype. View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=1592389 Reactome].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2770	Reversible hydration of carbon dioxide		Carbonic anhydrases reversibly catalyze the hydration of carbon dioxide and directly produce bicarbonate and protons, bypassing the formation of carbonic acid (reviewed in Lindskog 1997, Breton 2001, Esbaugh and Tufts 2006, Boron 2010, Gilmour 2010). Carbonic anhydrase deprotonates water to yield a zinc-hydroxyl group and a proton which is transferred to external buffer molecules via histidine or glutamate residues in carbonic anhydrase. The hydroxyl group reacts with carbon dioxide in the active site to yield bicarbonate. A water molecule displaces the bicarbonate and the reaction cycle begins again. There are currently 12 known active carbonic anhydrases in humans. View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=1475029 Reactome].		9606

In the absence of Wnt signaling, this complex controls the levels of cytoplamic beta-catenin. Beta-catenin associates with and is phosphorylated by the destruction complex. Phosphorylated beta-catenin is recognized and ubiquitinated by the SCF-beta TrCP ubiquitin ligase complex and is subsequently degraded by the proteasome (reviewed in Kimelman and Xu, 2006).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2774	Degradation of the extracellular matrix		Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), previously referred to as matrixins because of their role in degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), are zinc and calcium dependent proteases belonging to the metzincin family. They contain a characteristic zinc-binding motif HEXXHXXGXXH (Stocker & Bode 1995) and a conserved Methionine which forms a Met-turn. Humans have 24 MMP genes giving rise to 23 MMP proteins, as MMP23 is encoded by two identical genes. All MMPs contain an N-terminal secretory signal peptide and a prodomain with a conserved PRCGXPD motif that in the inactive enzyme is localized with the catalytic site, the cysteine acting as a fourth unpaired ligand for the catalytic zinc atom. Activation involves delocalization of the domain containing this cysteine by a conformational change or proteolytic cleavage, a mechanism referred to as the cysteine-switch (Van Wart & Birkedal-Hansen 1990).  Most MMPs are secreted but the membrane type MT-MMPs are membrane anchored and some MMPs may act on intracellular proteins. Various domains determine substrate specificity, cell localization and activation (Hadler-Olsen et al. 2011). MMPs are regulated by transcription, cellular location (most are not activated until secreted), activating proteinases that can be other MMPs, and by metalloproteinase inhibitors such as the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). MMPs are best known for their role in the degradation and removal of ECM molecules. In addition, cleavage of the ECM and other cell surface molecules can release ECM-bound growth factors, and a number of non-ECM proteins are substrates of MMPs (Nagase et al. 2006). MMPs can be divided into subgroups based on domain structure and substrate specificity but it is clear that these are somewhat artificial, many MMPs belong to more than one functional group (Vise & Nagase 2003, Somerville et al. 2003).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2775	Toll-like Receptor Cascades		In human, ten members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family (TLR1-TLR10) have been identified (TLR11 has been found in mouse, but not in human). All TLRs have a similar Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain in their cytoplasmic region and an Ig-like domain in the extracellular region, where each is enriched with a varying number of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). Each TLR can recognize specific microbial pathogen components. The binding pathogenic component to TLR initializes signaling pathways that lead to induction of Interferon alpha/beta and inflammatory cytokines. There are two main signaling pathways. The first is a MyD88-dependent pathway that is common to all TLRs, except TLR3; the second is a TRIF(TICAM1)-dependent pathway that is peculiar to TLR3 and TLR4. TLR4-mediated signaling pathway via TRIF requires adapter molecule TRAM (TRIF-related adapter molecule or TICAM2). TRAM is thought to bridge between the activated TLR4 complex and TRIF.(Takeda & Akira 2004; Akira 2003; Takeda & Akira 2005; Kawai 2005; Heine & Ulmer 2005).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2776	Visual phototransduction		Visual phototransduction is the process by which photon absorption by visual pigment molecules in photoreceptor cells is converted to an electrical cellular response. The events in this process are photochemical, biochemical and electrophysiological and are highly conserved across many species. This process occurs in two types of photoreceptors in the retina, rods and cones. Each type consists of two parts, the outer segment which detects a photon signal and the inner segment which contains the necessary machinery for cell metabolism. Each type of cell functions differently. Rods are very light sensitive but their flash response is slow so they work best in twilight conditions but are not good at detecting objects moving quickly. Cones are less light-sensitive and have a fast flash response so they work best in daylight conditions and are better at detecting fast moving objects than rods.<br><br>The visual pigment consists of a chromophore (11-cis-retinal, 11cRAL, A1) covalently attached to a GPCR opsin family member. The linkage is via a Schiff base forming retinylidene protein. Upon photon absorption, 11cRAL isomerises to all-trans retinal (atRAL), changing the conformation of opsin to an activated form which can activate the regulatory G protein transducin (Gt). The alpha subunit of Gt activates phosphodiesterase which hydrolyses cGMP to 5'-GMP. As high level of cGMP keep cGMP-gated sodium channels open, the lowering of cGMP levels closes these channels which causes hyperpolarization of the cell and subsequently, closure of voltage-gated calcium channels. As calcium levels drop, the level of the neurotransmitter glutamate also drops causing depolarization of the cell. This effectively relays the light signal to postsynaptic neurons as electrical signal (Burns & Pugh 2010, Korenbrot 2012, Pugh & Lamb 1993).<br><br>11cRAL cannot be synthesised in vertebrates. Vitamin A from many dietary sources is the precursor for 11cRAL. It is taken from food in the form of esters such as retinyl acetate or palmitate or one of four caretenoids (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, gamma-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin). Retinoids are transported from the gut to be stored in liver, until required by target organs such as the eye (Harrison & Hussain 2001, Harrison 2005). In the eye, in the form 11cRAL, it is used in the retinoid (visual) cycle to initiate phototransduction and for visual pigment regeneration to ready the photoreceptor for the next phototransduction event (von Lintig 2012, Blomhoff & Blomhoff 2006, von Lintig et al. 2010, D'Ambrosio et al. 2011, Wang & Kefalov 2011, Kefalov 2012, Wolf 2004).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2777	Translocation of SLC2A4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane		In adipocytes and myocytes insulin signaling causes intracellular vesicles carrying the GLUT4 (SLC2A4) glucose transporter to translocate to the plasma membrane, allowing the cells to take up glucose from the bloodstream (reviewed in Zaid et al. 2008, Leney and Tavare 2009, Bogan and Kandror 2010, Foley et al. 2011, Hoffman and Elmendorf 2011, Kandror and Pilch 2011, Jaldin-Fincati et al. 2017). In myocytes muscle contraction alone can also cause translocation of GLUT4.<br>Though the entire pathway leading to GLUT4 translocation has not been elucidated, several steps are known. Insulin activates the kinases AKT1 and AKT2. Muscle contraction activates the kinase AMPK-alpha2 and possibly also AKT. AKT2 and, to a lesser extent, AKT1 phosphorylate the RAB GTPase activators TBC1D1 and TBC1D4, causing them to bind 14-3-3 proteins and lose GTPase activation activity. As a result RAB proteins (probably RAB8A, RAB10, RAB14 and possibly RAB13) accumulate GTP. The connection between RAB:GTP and vesicle translocation is unknown but may involve recruitment and activation of myosins.<br>Myosins 1C, 2A, 2B, 5A, 5B have all been shown to play a role in translocating GLUT4 vesicles near the periphery of the cell. Following docking at the plasma membrane the vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane in a process that depends on interaction between VAMP2 on the vesicle and SNAP23 and SYNTAXIN-4 at the plasma membrane.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2778	SUMOylation		Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifiers (SUMOs) are a family of 3 proteins (SUMO1,2,3) that are reversibly conjugated to lysine residues of target proteins via a glycine-lysine isopeptide bond (reviewed in Hay 2013, Hannoun et al. 2010, Gareau and Lima 2010, Wilkinson and Henley 2010, Wang and Dasso 2009). Proteomic methods have yielded estimates of hundreds of target proteins. Targets are mostly located in the nucleus and therefore SUMOylation disproportionately affects gene expression.<br>SUMOs are initially translated as proproteins possessing extra amino acid residues at the C-terminus which are removed by the SUMO processing endoproteases SENP1,2,5 (Hay 2007). Different SENPs have significantly different efficiencies with different SUMOs. The processing exposes a glycine residue at the C-terminus that is activated by ATP-dependent thiolation at cysteine-173 of UBA2 in a complex with SAE1, the E1 complex. The SUMO is transferred from E1 to cysteine-93 of a single E2 enzyme, UBC9 (UBE2I). UBC9 with or, in some cases, without an E3 ligase conjugates the glycine C-terminus of SUMO to an epsilon amino group of a lysine residue on the target protein. SUMO2 and SUMO3 may then be further polymerized, forming chains. SUMO1 is unable to form polymers.<br> Conjugated SUMO can act as a biinding site for proteins possessing SUMO interaction motifs (SIMs) and can also directly affect the formation of complexes between the target protein and other proteins.<br>Conjugated SUMOs are removed by cleavage of the isopeptide bond by processing enzymes SENP1,2,3,5. The processing enzymes SENP6 and SENP7 edit chains of SUMO2 and SUMO3. View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=2990846 Reactome].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2780	Signaling by ERBB2		ERBB2, also known as HER2 or NEU, is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) belonging to the EGFR family. ERBB2 possesses an extracellular domain that does not bind any known ligand, contrary to other EGFR family members, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain consisting of an active kinase and a C-tail with multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Inactive ERBB2 is associated with a chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and its co-chaperone CDC37 (Xu et al. 2001, Citri et al. 2004, Xu et al. 2005). In addition, ERBB2 is associated with ERBB2IP (also known as ERBIN or LAP2), a protein responsible for proper localization of ERBB2. In epithelial cells, ERBB2IP restricts expression of ERBB2 to basolateral plasma membrane regions (Borg et al. 2000).<br><br>ERBB2 becomes activated by forming a heterodimer with another ligand-activated EGFR family member, either EGFR, ERBB3 or ERBB4, which is accompanied by dissociation of chaperoning proteins HSP90 and CDC37 (Citri et al. 2004), as well as ERBB2IP (Borg et al. 2000) from ERBB2. ERBB2 heterodimers function to promote cell proliferation, cell survival and differentiation, depending on the cellular context. ERBB2 can also be activated by homodimerization when it is overexpressed, in cancer for example. <br><br>In cells expressing both ERBB2 and EGFR, EGF stimulation of EGFR leads to formation of both ERBB2:EGFR heterodimers (Wada et al. 1990, Karunagaran et al. 1996) and EGFR homodimers. Heterodimers of ERBB2 and EGFR trans-autophosphorylate on twelve tyrosine residues, six in the C-tail of EGFR and six in the C-tail of ERBB2 - Y1023, Y1139, Y1196, Y1221, Y1222 and Y1248 (Margolis et al. 1989, Hazan et al. 1990,Walton et  al. 1990, Helin et al. 1991, Ricci et al. 1995, Pinkas-Kramarski 1996). Phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the C-tail of EGFR and ERBB2 serve as docking sites for downstream signaling molecules. Three key signaling pathways activated by ERBB2:EGFR heterodimers are RAF/MAP kinase cascade, PI3K-induced AKT signaling, and signaling by phospholipase C gamma (PLCG1). Downregulation of EGFR signaling is mediated by ubiquitin ligase CBL, and is shown under Signaling by EGFR.<br><br>In cells expressing ERBB2 and ERBB3, ERBB3 activated by neuregulin NRG1 or NRG2 binding (Tzahar et al. 1994) forms a heterodimer with ERBB2 (Pinkas-Kramarski et al. 1996, Citri et al. 2004). ERBB3 is the only EGFR family member with no kinase activity, and can only function in heterodimers, with ERBB2 being its preferred heterodimerization partner. After heterodimerization, ERBB2 phosphorylates ten tyrosine residues in the C-tail of ERBB3, Y1054, Y1197, Y1199, Y1222, Y1224, Y1260, Y1262, Y1276, Y1289 and Y1328 (Prigent et al. 1994, Pinkas-Kramarski et al. 1996, Vijapurkar et al. 2003, Li et al. 2007) that subsequently serve as docking sites for downstream signaling molecules, resulting in activation of PI3K-induced AKT signaling and RAF/MAP kinase cascade. Signaling by ERBB3 is downregulated by the action of RNF41 ubiquitin ligase, also known as NRDP1. <br><br>In cells expressing ERBB2 and ERBB4, ligand stimulated ERBB4 can either homodimerize or form heterodimers with ERBB2 (Li et al. 2007), resulting in trans-autophosphorylation of ERBB2 and ERBB4 on C-tail tyrosine residues that will subsequently serve as docking sites for downstream signaling molecules, leading to activation of RAF/MAP kinase cascade and, in the case of ERBB4 CYT1 isoforms, PI3K-induced AKT signaling (Hazan et al. 1990, Cohen et al. 1996, Li et al. 2007, Kaushansky et al. 2008). Signaling by ERBB4 is downregulated by the action of WWP1 and ITCH ubiquitin ligases, and is shown under Signaling by ERBB4.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2781	Signaling by ERBB4		ERBB4, also known as HER4, belongs to the ERBB family of receptors, which also includes ERBB1 (EGFR/HER1), ERBB2 (HER2/NEU) and ERBB3 (HER3). Similar to EGFR, ERBB4 has an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain which contains an active tyrosine kinase and a C-tail with multiple phosphorylation sites. At least three and possibly four splicing isoforms of ERBB4 exist that differ in their C-tail and/or the extracellular juxtamembrane regions: ERBB4 JM-A CYT1, ERBB4 JM-A CYT2 and ERBB4 JM-B CYT1 (the existence of ERBB4 JM-B CYT2 has not been confirmed). <br><br>ERBB4 becomes activated by binding one of its seven ligands, three of which, HB-EGF, epiregulin EPR and betacellulin BTC, are EGF-like (Elenius et al. 1997, Riese et al. 1998), while four, NRG1, NRG2, NRG3 and NRG4, belong to the related neuregulin family (Tzahar et al. 1994, Carraway et al. 1997, Zhang et al. 1997, Hayes et al. 2007). Upon ligand binding, ERBB4 forms homodimers (Sweeney et al. 2000) or it heterodimerizes with ERBB2 (Li et al. 2007). Dimers of ERBB4 undergo trans-autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues in the C-tail (Cohen et al. 1996, Kaushansky et al. 2008, Hazan et al. 1990, Li et al. 2007), triggering downstream signaling cascades. The pathway Signaling by ERBB4 only shows signaling by ERBB4 homodimers. Signaling by heterodimers of ERBB4 and ERBB2 is shown in the pathway Signaling by ERBB2. Ligand-stimulated ERBB4 is also able to form heterodimers with ligand-stimulated EGFR (Cohen et al. 1996) and ligand-stimulated ERBB3 (Riese et al. 1995). Dimers of ERBB4 with EGFR and dimers of ERBB4 with ERBB3 were demonstrated in mouse cell lines in which human ERBB4 and EGFR or ERBB3 were exogenously expressed. These heterodimers undergo trans-autophosphorylation. The promiscuous heteromerization of ERBBs adds combinatorial diversity to ERBB signaling processes. As ERBB4 binds more ligands than other ERBBs, but has restricted expression, ERBB4 expression channels responses to ERBB ligands. The signaling capabilities of the four receptors have been compared (Schulze et al. 2005).<br><br>As for other receptor tyrosine kinases, ERBB4 signaling effectors are largely dictated through binding of effector proteins to ERBB4 peptides that are phosphorylated upon ligand binding. All splicing isoforms of ERBB4 possess two tyrosine residues in the C-tail that serve as docking sites for SHC1 (Kaushansky et al. 2008, Pinkas-Kramarski et al. 1996, Cohen et al. 1996). Once bound to ERBB4, SHC1 becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by the tyrosine kinase activity of ERBB4, which enables it to recruit the complex of GRB2 and SOS1, resulting in the guanyl-nucleotide exchange on RAS and activation of RAF and MAP kinase cascade (Kainulainen et al. 2000). <br><br>The CYT1 isoforms of ERBB4 also possess a C-tail tyrosine residue that, upon trans-autophosphorylation, serves as a docking site for the p85 alpha subunit of PI3K (Kaushansky et al. 2008, Cohen et al. 1996), leading to assembly of an active PI3K complex that converts PIP2 to PIP3 and activates AKT signaling (Kainulainen et al. 2000). <br><br>Besides signaling as a conventional transmembrane receptor kinase, ERBB4 differs from other ERBBs in that JM-A isoforms signal through efficient release of a soluble intracellular domain. Ligand activated homodimers of ERBB4 JM-A isoforms (ERBB4 JM-A CYT1 and ERBB4 JM-A CYT2) undergo proteolytic cleavage by ADAM17 (TACE) in the juxtamembrane region, resulting in shedding of the extracellular domain and formation of an 80 kDa membrane bound ERBB4 fragment known as ERBB4 m80 (Rio et al. 2000, Cheng et al. 2003). ERBB4 m80 undergoes further proteolytic cleavage, mediated by the gamma-secretase complex, which releases the soluble 80 kDa ERBB4 intracellular domain, known as ERBB4 s80 or E4ICD, into the cytosol (Ni et al. 2001). ERBB4 s80 is able to translocate to the nucleus, promote nuclear translocation of various transcription factors, and act as a transcription co-factor. For example, in mammary cells, ERBB4 binds SH2 transcription factor STAT5A. ERBB4 s80 shuttles STAT5A to the nucleus, and actsa as a STAT5A co-factor in binding to and promoting transcription from the beta-casein (CSN2) promoter, and may be involved in the regulation of other lactation-related genes (Jones et al. 1999, Williams et al. 2004, Muraoka-Cook et al. 2008). ERBB4 s80 binds activated estrogen receptor in the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional co-factor in promoting transcription of some estrogen-regulated genes, including progesterone receptor gene NR3C3 and CXCL12 (SDF1) (Zhu et al. 2006). In neuronal precursors, ERBB4 s80 binds the complex of TAB and NCOR1, helps to move the complex into the nucleus, and is a co-factor of TAB:NCOR1-mediated inhibition of expression of astrocyte differentiation genes GFAP and S100B (Sardi et al. 2006).<br><br>The C-tail of ERBB4 possesses several WW-domain binding motifs (three in CYT1 isoform and two in CYT2 isoform), which enable interaction of ERBB4 with WW-domain containing proteins. ERBB4 s80, through WW-domain binding motifs, interacts with YAP1 transcription factor, a known proto-oncogene, and is a co-regulator of YAP1-mediated transcription in association with TEAD transcription factors (Komuro et al. 2003, Omerovic et al. 2004). Hence, the WW binding motif couples ERBB4 to the major effector arm of the HIPPO signaling pathway. The tumor suppressor WWOX, another WW-domain containing protein, competes with YAP1 in binding to ERBB4 s80 and prevents translocation of ERBB4 s80 to the nucleus (Aqeilan et al. 2005).<br><br>WW-domain binding motifs in the C-tail of ERBB4 play an important role in the downregulation of ERBB4 receptor signaling, enabling the interaction of intact ERBB4, ERBB4 m80 and ERBB4 s80 with NEDD4 family of E3 ubiquitin ligases WWP1 and ITCH. The interaction of WWP1 and ITCH with intact ERBB4 is independent of receptor activation and autophosphorylation. Binding of WWP1 and ITCH ubiquitin ligases leads to ubiquitination of ERBB4 and its cleavage products, and subsequent degradation through both proteasomal and lysosomal routes (Omerovic et al. 2007, Feng et al. 2009). In addition, the s80 cleavage product of ERBB4 JM-A CYT-1 isoform is the target of NEDD4 ubiquitin ligase. NEDD4 binds ERBB4 JM-A CYT-1 s80 (ERBB4jmAcyt1s80) through its PIK3R1 interaction site and mediates ERBB4jmAcyt1s80 ubiquitination, thereby decreasing the amount of ERBB4jmAcyt1s80 that reaches the nucleus (Zeng et al. 2009).<br><br>ERBB4 also binds the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, and inhibitor of p53 (Arasada et al. 2005). Other proteins that bind to ERBB4 intracellular domain have been identified by co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (Gilmore-Hebert et al., 2010), and include transcriptional co-repressor TRIM28/KAP1, which promotes chromatin compaction. DNA damage signaling through ATM releases TRIM28-associated heterochromatinization. Interactions of ERBB4 with TRIM28 and MDM2 may be important for integration of growth factor responses and DNA damage responses.<br><br>In human breast cancer cell lines, ERBB4 activation enhances anchorage-independent colony formation in soft agar but inhibits cell growth in a monolayer culture. Different ERBB4 ligands induce different gene expression changes in breast cancer cell lines. Some of the genes induced in response to ERBB4 signaling in breast cancer cell lines are RAB2, EPS15R and GATA4. It is not known if these gene are direct transcriptional targets of ERBB4 (Amin et al. 2004).<br><br>Transcriptome and ChIP-seq comparisons of full-length and intracellular domain isoforms in isogenic MCF10A mammary cell background have revealed the diversification of ERBB4 signaling engendered by alternative splicing and cleavage (Wali et al., 2014). ERBB4 broadly affected protease expression, cholesterol biosynthesis, HIF1-alpha signaling, and HIPPO signaling pathways, and other pathways were differentially activated by CYT1 and CYT2 isoforms. For example, CYT1 promoted expression of transcription factors TWIST1 and SNAIL1 that promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition. HIF1-alpha and HIPPO signaling are mediated, respectively, by binding of ERBB4 to HIF1-alpha and to YAP (Paatero et al., 2012, Komuro et al., 2003). ERBB4 increases activity of the transcription factor SREBF2, resulting in increased expression of SREBF2-target genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. The mechanism is not known and may involve facilitation of SREBF2 cleavage through ERBB4-mediated PI3K signaling (Haskins et al. 2016).<br><br>In some contexts, ERBB4 promotes growth suppression or apoptosis (Penington et al., 2002). Activation of ERBB4 in breast cancer cell lines leads to JNK dependent increase in BRCA1 mRNA level and mitotic cell cycle delay, but the exact mechanism has not been elucidated (Muraoka Cook et al. 2006). The nature of growth responses may be connected with the spliced isoforms expressed. In comparisons of CYT1 vs CYT2 (full-length and ICD) expression in mammary cells, CYT1 was a weaker growth inducer, associated with attenuated MAPK signaling relative to CYT2 (Wali et al., 2014). ERBB4 s80 is also able to translocate to the mitochondrial matrix, presumably when its nuclear translocation is inhibited. Once in the mitochondrion, the BH3 domain of ERBB4, characteristic of BCL2 family members, may enable it to act as a pro apoptotic factor (Naresh et al. 2006).<br><br>ERBB4 plays important roles in the developing and adult nervous system. Erbb4 deficiency in somatostatin-expressing neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus alters behaviors dependent on sensory selection (Ahrens et al. 2015). NRG1-activated ERBB4 signaling enhances AMPA receptor responses through PKC-dependent AMPA receptor exocytosis. This results in an increased excitatory input to parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex and regulates visual cortical plasticity (Sun et al. 2016). NRG1-activated ERBB4 signaling is involved in GABAergic activity in amygdala which mediates fear conditioning (fear memory) (Lu et al. 2014). Conditional Erbb4 deletion from fast-spiking interneurons, chandelier and basket cells of the cerebral cortex leads to synaptic defects associated with increased locomotor activity and abnormal emotional, social and cognitive function that can be linked to some of the schizophrenia features. The level of GAD1 (GAD67) protein is reduced in the cortex of conditional Erbb4 mutants. GAD1 is a GABA synthesizing enzyme. Cortical mRNA levels of GAD67 are consistently decreased in schizophrenia (Del Pino et al. 2014). Erbb4 is expressed in the GABAergic neurons of the bed nucleus stria terminalis, a part of the extended amygdala. Inhibition of NRG1-triggered ERBB4 signaling induces anxiety-like behavior, which depends on GABAergic neurotransmission. NRG1-ERBB4 signaling stimulates presynaptic GABA release, but the exact mechanism is not known (Geng et al. 2016). NRG1 protects cortical interneurons against ischemic brain injury through ERBB4-mediated increase in GABAergic transmission (Guan et al. 2015). NRG2-activated ERBB4 can reduce the duration of GABAergic transmission by binding to GABA receptors at the postsynaptic membrane via their GABRA1 subunit and promoting endocytosis of GABA receptors (Mitchell et al. 2013). NRG1 promotes synchronization of prefrontal cortex interneurons in an ERBB4 dependent manner (Hou et al. 2014). NRG1-ERBB4 signaling protects neurons from the cell death induced by a mutant form of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Woo et al. 2012).<br><br>Clinical relevance of ERBB4 has been identified in several contexts. In cancer, putative and validated gain-of-function mutations or gene amplification that may be drivers have been identified at modest frequencies, and may also contribute to resistance to EGFR and ERBB2-targeted therapies. This is noteworthy as ERBB4 kinase activity is inhibited by pan-ERBB tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including lapatinib, which is approved by the US FDA. The reduced prevalence relative to EGFR and ERBB2 in cancer may reflect more restricted expression of ERBB4, or differential signaling, as specific ERBB4 isoforms have been linked to growth inhibition or apoptosis in experimental systems. ERBB2/ERBB4 heterodimers protect cardiomyocytes, so reduced activity of ERBB4 in patients treated with the ERBB2-targeted therapeutic antibody trastuzumab may contribute to the cardiotoxicity of this agent when used in combination with (cardiotoxic) anthracyclines.<br><br>With the importance of ERBB4 in developing and adult nervous system, NRG1 and/or ERBB4 polymorphisms, splicing aberrations and mutations have been linked to nervous system disorders including schizophrenia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, although these findings are not yet definitive.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2784	Binding and uptake of ligands by scavenger receptors		Scavenger receptors bind free extracellular ligands as the initial step in clearance of the ligands from the body (reviewed in Ascenzi et al. 2005, Areschoug and Gordon 2009, Nielsen et al. 2010). Some scavenger receptors, such as the CD163-haptoglobin system, are specific for only one ligand. Others, such as the SCARA receptors (SR-A receptors) are less specific, binding several ligands which share a common property, such as polyanionic charges.<br>Brown and Goldstein originated the idea of receptors dedicated to scavenging aberrant molecules such as modified low density lipoprotein particles (Goldstein et al. 1979) and such receptors have been shown to participate in pathological processes such as atherosclerosis.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2786	Pre-NOTCH Expression and Processing		In humans and other mammals the NOTCH gene family has four members, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3 and NOTCH4, encoded on four different chromosomes. Their transcription is developmentally regulated and tissue specific, but very little information exists on molecular mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. Translation of NOTCH mRNAs is negatively regulated by a number of recently discovered microRNAs (Li et al. 2009, Pang et al.2010, Ji et al. 2009, Kong et al. 2010, Marcet et al. 2011, Ghisi et al. 2011, Song et al. 2009, Hashimoto et al. 2010, Costa et al. 2009). <br><br>  The nascent forms of NOTCH precursors, Pre-NOTCH1, Pre-NOTCH2, Pre-NOTCH3 and Pre-NOTCH4, undergo extensive posttranslational modifications in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus to become functional. In the endoplasmic reticulum, conserved serine and threonine residues in the EGF repeats of NOTCH extracellular domain are fucosylated and glucosylated by POFUT1 and POGLUT1, respectively (Yao et al. 2011, Stahl et al. 2008, Wang et al. 2001, Shao et al. 2003, Acar et al. 2008, Fernandez Valdivia et al. 2011). <br><br>  In the Golgi apparatus, fucose groups attached to NOTCH EGF repeats can be elongated by additional glycosylation steps initiated by fringe enzymes (Bruckner et al. 2000, Moloney et al. 2000, Cohen et al. 1997, Johnston et al. 1997, Chen et al. 2001). Fringe-mediated modification modulates NOTCH signaling but is not an obligatory step in Pre-NOTCH processing. Typically, processing of Pre-NOTCH in the Golgi involves cleavage by FURIN convertase (Blaumueller et al. 1997, Logeat et al. 1998, Gordon et al. 2009, Rand et al. 2000, Chan et al. 1998). The cleavage of NOTCH results in formation of mature NOTCH heterodimers that consist of NOTCH extracellular domain (NEC i.e. NECD) and NOTCH transmembrane and intracellular domain (NTM i.e. NTMICD). NOTCH heterodimers translocate to the cell surface where they function in cell to cell signaling. View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=1912422 Reactome].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2787	Syndecan interactions		Syndecans are type I transmembrane proteins, with an N-terminal ectodomain that contains several consensus sequences for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachment and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Syndecan-1 and -3 GAG attachment sites occur in two distinct clusters, one near the N-terminus and the other near the membrane-attachment site, separated by a proline and threonine-rich 'spacer'. Syndecan ectodomain sequences are poorly conserved in the family and between species, but the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains are highly conserved. Syndecan-1 and -3 form a subfamily. Syndecan core proteins form dimers (Choi et al. 2007) and at least syndecan-3 and -4 form oligomers (Asundi & Carey 1995, Shin et al. 2012).  Syndecan-1 is the major syndecan of epithelial cells including vascular endothelium. Syndecan-2 is present mostly in mesenchymal, neuronal and smooth muscle cells. Syndecan-3 is the major syndecan of the nervous system, while syndecan-4 is ubiquitously expressed but at lower levels than the other syndecans (refs in Alexopoulou et al. 2007). The core syndecan protein has three to five heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate chains, which interact with a variety of ligands including fibroblast growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, fibronectin, collagen, vitronectin and several integrins. Syndecans may act as integrin coreceptors. Interactions between fibronectin and syndecans are modulated by tenascin-C. Syndecans bind a wide variety of soluble and insoluble ligands, inckluding extracellular matrix components, cell adhesion molecules, growth factors, cytokines, and proteinases. As the cleaved ectodomains of syndecans retain the ability to bind ligands, ectodomain shedding is a mechanism for releasing soluble effectors that may compete for ligands with their cell-bound counterparts (Kainulainen et al. 1998). Shed  ectodomains are found in inflammatory fluids (Subramanian et al. 1997) and may induce the proliferation of cancer cells (Maeda et al. 2004).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2788	Sphingolipid metabolism		Sphingolipids are derivatives of long chain sphingoid bases such as sphingosine (trans-1,3-dihydroxy 2-amino-4-octadecene), an 18-carbon unsaturated amino alcohol which is the most abundant sphingoid base in mammals. Amide linkage of a fatty acid to sphingosine yields ceramides. Esterification of phosphocholine to ceramides yields sphingomyelin, and ceramide glycosylation yields glycosylceramides. Introduction of sialic acid residues yields gangliosides. These molecules appear to be essential components of cell membranes, and intermediates in the pathways of sphingolipid synthesis and breakdown modulate processes including apoptosis and T cell trafficking.<p>While sphingolipids are abundant in a wide variety of foodstuffs, these dietary molecules are mostly degraded by the intestinal flora and intestinal enzymes. The body primarily depends on de novo synthesis for its sphingolipid supply (Hannun and Obeid 2008; Merrill 2002). De novo synthesis proceeds in four steps: the condensation of palmitoyl-CoA and serine to form 3-ketosphinganine, the reduction of 3-ketosphinganine to sphinganine, the acylation of sphinganine with a long-chain fatty acyl CoA to form dihydroceramide, and the desaturation of dihydroceramide to form ceramide.<p>Other sphingolipids involved in signaling are derived from ceramide and its biosynthetic intermediates. These include sphinganine (dihydrosphingosine) 1-phosphate, phytoceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate.<p>Sphingomyelin is synthesized in a single step in the membrane of the Golgi apparatus from ceramides generated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and transferred to the Golgi by CERT (ceramide transfer protein), an isoform of COL4A3BP that is associated with the ER membrane as a complex with PPM1L (protein phosphatase 1-like) and VAPA or VAPB (VAMP-associated proteins A or B). Sphingomyelin synthesis appears to be regulated primarily at the level of this transport process through the reversible phosphorylation of CERT (Saito et al. 2008).<br> View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=428157 Reactome].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2790	WNT ligand biogenesis and trafficking		19 WNT proteins have been identified in human cells.  The WNTs are members of a conserved metazoan family of secreted morphogens that activate several signaling pathways in the responding cell: the canonical (beta-catenin) WNT signaling cascade and several non-canonical pathways, including the planar cell polarity (PCP), the regulation of intracellular calcium signaling and  activation of JNK kinases.  WNT proteins exist in a gradient outside the secreting cell and are able to act over both short and long ranges to promote proliferation, changes in cell migration and polarity and tissue homeostasis, among others (reviewed in Saito-Diaz et al, 2012; Willert and Nusse, 2012).  <br><br><br>The WNTs are ~40kDa proteins with 23 conserved cysteine residues in the N-terminal that may form intramolecular disulphide bonds. They also contain an N-terminal signal sequence and a number of N-linked glycosylation sites (Janda et al, 2012). In addition to being glycosylated, WNTs are also lipid-modified in the endoplasmic reticulum by a WNT-specific O-acyl-transferase, Porcupine (PORCN), contributing to their characteristic hydrophobicity.  PORCN-dependent palmitoylation is required for the secretion of WNT as well as its signaling activity, as either depletion of PORCN or mutation of the conserved serine acylation site results in the intracellular accumulation of WNT ligand (Takada et al, 2006; Barrott et al, 2011; Biechele et al, 2011; reviewed in Willert and Nusse, 2012).<br><br><br>Secretion of WNT requires a number of other dedicated factors including the sorting receptor Wntless (WLS) (also knownas Evi, Sprinter, and GPR177), which binds WNT and escorts it to the cell surface (Banziger et al, 2006; Bartscherer et al, 2006; Goodman et al, 2006).  A WNT-specific retromer containing SNX3 is subsequently required for the recycling of WLS back to the Golgi (reviewed in Herr et al, 2012; Johannes and Wunder,  2011).   Once at the cell surface, WNT makes extensive contacts with components of the extracellular matrix such as heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and may be bound by any of a number of regulatory proteins, including WIFs and SFRPs. The diffusion of the WNT ligand may be aided by its packing either into WNT multimers, exosomes or onto lipoprotein particles to shield the hydrophobic lipid adducts from the aqueous extracellular environment (Gross et al, 2012; Luga et al, 2012, Korkut et al, 2009; reviewed in Willert and Nusse, 2012).<br><br > View original pathway at:[http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=3238698 Reactome].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2791	Signaling by Activin		Activin was initially discovered as an activator of follicle stimulating hormone in the pituitary gland. It has since been shown to be an important participant in the differentiation of embryonic cells into mesodermal and endodermal layers. Activin binds the Activin receptor and triggers downstream events: phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 followed by activation of gene expression (reviewed in Attisano et al. 1996, Willis et al. 1996, Chen et al. 2006, Hinck 2012).  Activins are dimers comprising activin A (INHBA:INHBA), activin AB (INHBA:INHBB), and activin B (INHBB:INHBB). Activin first binds the type II receptor (ACVR2A, ACVR2B) and this complex then interacts with the type I receptor (ACVR1B, ACVR1C) (Attisano et al. 1996). The type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor and then the phosphorylated type I receptor phosphorylates SMAD2 and SMAD3. Dimers of phosphorylated SMAD2/3 bind SMAD4 and the resulting ternary complex enters the nucleus and activates target genes.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2792	MAP kinase activation		The mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, one of the most ancient and evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways, is involved in many processes of immune responses. The MAP kinases cascade transduces signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus in response to a wide range of stimuli (Chang and Karin, 2001; Johnson et al, 2002). <p>There are three major groups of MAP kinases<ul><li>the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases ERK1/2, <li>the p38 MAP kinase<li> and the c-Jun NH-terminal kinases JNK.</ul><p>ERK1 and ERK2 are activated in response to growth stimuli. Both JNKs and p38-MAPK are activated in response to a variety of cellular and environmental stresses. The MAP kinases are activated by dual phosphorylation of Thr and Tyr within the  tripeptide motif Thr-Xaa-Tyr. The sequence of this tripeptide motif is different in each group of MAP kinases: ERK (Thr-Glu-Tyr); p38 (Thr-Gly-Tyr); and JNK (Thr-Pro-Tyr).<p>MAPK activation is mediated by signal transduction in the conserved three-tiered kinase cascade: MAPKKKK (MAP4K or MKKKK or MAPKKK Kinase) activates the MAPKKK. The MAPKKKs then phosphorylates a dual-specificity protein kinase MAPKK, which in turn phosphorylates the MAPK.<p>The dual specificity MAP kinase kinases (MAPKK or MKK) differ for each group of MAPK. The ERK MAP kinases are activated by the MKK1 and MKK2; the p38 MAP kinases are activated by MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6; and the JNK pathway is activated by MKK4 and MKK7. The ability of MAP kinase kinases (MKKs, or MEKs) to recognize their cognate MAPKs is facilitated by a short docking motif (the D-site) in the MKK N-terminus, which binds to a complementary region on the MAPK. MAPKs then recognize many of their targets using the same strategy, because many MAPK substrates also contain D-sites.<p>The upstream signaling events in the TLR cascade that initiate and mediate the ERK signaling pathway remain unclear.

PPARalpha is also the target of fibrate drugs used to treat abnormal plasma lipid levels. <br>PPAR-alpha is a type II nuclear receptor (its subcellular location does not depend on ligand binding). PPAR-alpha forms heterodimers with Retinoid X receptor alpha (RXR-alpha), another type II nuclear receptor. PPAR-alpha is activated by binding fatty acid ligands, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids having 18-22 carbon groups and 2-6 double bonds. <br>The PPAR-alpha:RXR-alpha heterodimer binds peroxisome proliferator receptor elements (PPREs) in and around target genes. Binding of fatty acids and synthetic ligands causes a conformational change in PPAR-alpha such that it releases the corepressors and binds coactivators (CBP-SRC-HAT complex, ASC complex, and TRAP-Mediator complex) which initiate transcription of the target genes.<br>Target genes of PPAR-alpha participate in fatty acid transport, fatty acid oxidation, triglyceride clearance, lipoprotein production, and cholesterol homeostasis.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2798	Assembly of collagen fibrils and other multimeric structures		Collagen trimers in triple-helical form, referred to as procollagen or collagen molecules, are exported from the ER and trafficked through the Golgi network before secretion into the extracellular space. For fibrillar collagens namely types I, II, III, V, XI, XXIV and XXVII (Gordon & Hahn 2010, Ricard-Blum 2011) secretion is concomitant with processing of the N and C terminal collagen propeptides. These processed molecules are known as tropocollagens, considered to be the units of higher order collagen structures. They form within the extracellular space via a process that can proceed spontaneously, but in the cellular environment is regulated by many collagen binding proteins such as the FACIT (Fibril Associated Collagens with Interrupted Triple helices) family collagens and Small Leucine-Rich Proteoglycans (SLRPs). The architecture formed ultimately depends on the collagen subtype and the cellular conditions. Structures include the well-known fibrils and fibres formed by the major structural collagens type I and II plus several different types of supramolecular assembly (Bruckner 2010). The mechanical and physical properties of tissues depend on the spatial arrangement and composition of these collagen-containing structures (Kadler et al. 1996, Shoulders & Raines 2009, Birk & Bruckner 2011).<br><br> Fibrillar collagen structures are frequently heterotypic, composed of a major collagen type in association with smaller amounts of other types, e.g. type I collagen fibrils are associated with types III and V, while type II fibrils frequently contain types IX and XI (Wess 2005). Fibres composed exclusively of a single collagen type probably do not exist, as type I and II fibrils require collagens V and XI respectively as nucleators (Kadler et al. 2008, Wenstrup et al. 2011).  Much of the structural understanding of collagen fibrils has been obtained with fibril-forming collagens, particularly type I, but some central features are believed to apply to at least the other fibrillar collagen subtypes (Wess 2005). Fibril diameter and length varies considerably, depending on the tissue and collagen types (Fang et al. 2012). The reasons for this are poorly understood (Wess 2005).<br><br>Some tissues such as skin have fibres that are approximately the same diameter while others such as tendon or cartilage have a bimodal distribution of thick and thin fibrils. Mature type I collagen fibrils in tendon are up to 1 cm in length, with a diameter of approx. 500 nm. An individual fibrillar collagen triple helix is less than 1.5 nm in diameter and around 300 nm long; collagen molecules must assemble to give rise to the higher-order fibril structure, a process known as fibrillogenesis, prevented by the presence of C-terminal propeptides (Kadler et al. 1987). In electron micrographs, fibrils have a banded appearance, due to regular gaps where fewer collagen molecules overlap, which occur because the fibrils are aligned in a quarter-stagger arrangement (Hodge & Petruska 1963). Collagen microfibrils are believed to have a quasi-hexagonal unit cell, with tropocollagen arranged to form supertwisted, right-handed microfibrils that interdigitate with neighbouring microfibrils, leading to a spiral-like structure for the mature collagen fibril (Orgel et al. 2006, Holmes & Kadler 2006).<br><br>Neighbouring tropocollagen monomers interact with each other and are cross-linked covalently by lysyl oxidase (Orgel et al. 2000, Maki 2006). Mature collagen fibrils are stabilized by lysyl oxidase-mediated cross-links. Hydroxylysyl pyridinoline and lysyl pyridinoline cross-links form between (hydroxy) lysine and hydroxylysine residues in bone and cartilage (Eyre et al. 1984). Arginoline cross-links can form in cartilage (Eyre et al. 2010); mature bovine articular cartilage contains roughly equimolar amounts of arginoline and hydroxylysyl pyridinoline based on peptide yields. Mature collagen fibrils in skin are stabilized by the lysyl oxidase-mediated cross-link histidinohydroxylysinonorleucine (Yamauch et al. 1987). Due to the quarter-staggered arrangement of collagen molecules in a fibril, telopeptides most often interact with the triple helix of a neighbouring collagen molecule in the fibril, except for collagen molecules in register staggered by 4D from another collagen molecule. Fibril aggregation in vitro can be unipolar or bipolar, influenced by temperature and levels of C-proteinase, suggesting a role for the N- and C- propeptides in regulation of the aggregation process (Kadler et al. 1996). In vivo, collagen molecules at the fibril surface may retain their N-propeptides, suggesting that this may limit further accretion, or alternatively represents a transient stage in a model whereby fibrils grow in diameter through a cycle of deposition, cleavage and further deposition (Chapman 1989).<br><br>In vivo, fibrils are often composed from more than one type of collagen. Type III collagen is found associated with type I collagen in dermal fibrils, with the collagen III on the periphery, suggesting a regulatory role (Fleischmajer et al. 1990). Type V collagen associates with type I collagen fibrils, where it may limit fibril diameter (Birk et al. 1990, White et al. 1997). Type IX associates with the surface of narrow diameter collagen II fibrils in cartilage and the cornea (Wu et al. 1992, Eyre et al. 2004). Highly specific patterns of crosslinking sites suggest that collagen IX functions in interfibrillar networking (Wess 2005). Type XII and XIV collagens are localized near the surface of banded collagen I fibrils (Nishiyama et al. 1994). Certain fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACITs) associate with the surface of collagen fibrils, where they may serve to limit fibril fusion and thereby regulate fibril diameter (Gordon & Hahn 2010). Collagen XV, a member of the multiplexin family, is almost exclusively associated with the fibrillar collagen network, in very close proximity to the basement membrane. In human tissues collagen XV is seen linking banded collagen fibers subjacent to the basement membrane (Amenta et al. 2005). Type XIV collagen, SLRPs and discoidin domain receptors also regulate fibrillogenesis (Ansorge et al. 2009, Kalamajski et al. 2010, Flynn et al. 2010).<br><br>Collagen IX is cross-linked to the surface of collagen type II fibrils (Eyre et al. 1987). Type XII and XIV collagens are found in association with type I (Walchli et al. 1994) and type II (Watt et al. 1992, Eyre 2002) fibrils in cartilage. They are thought to associate non-covalently via their COL1/NC1 domains (Watt et al. 1992, Eyre 2002).  <br><br>Some non-fibrillar collagens form supramolecular assemblies that are distinct from typical fibrils. Collagen VII forms anchoring fibrils, composed of antiparallel dimers that connect the dermis to the epidermis (Bruckner-Tuderman 2009). During fibrillogenesis, the nascent type VII procollagen molecules dimerize in an antiparallel manner. The C-propeptides are then removed by Bone morphogenetic protein 1 (Rattenholl et al. 2002) and the processed antiparallel dimers aggregate laterally. Collagens VIII and X form hexagonal networks and collagen VI forms beaded filament (Gordon & Hahn 2010, Ricard-Blum et al. 2011).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2799	Regulation of IGF transport and uptake by IGF binding proteins		The family of Insulin like Growth Factor Binding Proteins (IGFBPs) share 50% amino acid identity with conserved N terminal and C terminal regions responsible for binding Insulin like Growth Factors I and II (IGF I and IGF II). Most circulating IGFs are in complexes with IGFBPs, which are believed to increase the residence of IGFs in the body, modulate availability of IGFs to target receptors for IGFs, reduce insulin like effects of IGFs, and act as signaling molecules independently of IGFs.About 75% of circulating IGFs are in 1500 220 KDa complexes with IGFBP3 and ALS. Such complexes are too large to pass the endothelial barrier. The remaining 20 25% of IGFs are bound to other IGFBPs in 40 50 KDa complexes. IGFs are released from IGF:IGFBP complexes by proteolysis of the IGFBP. IGFs become active after release, however IGFs may also have activity when still bound to some IGFBPs.IGFBP1 is enriched in amniotic fluid and is produced in the liver under control of insulin (insulin suppresses production). IGFBP1 binding stimulates IGF function. It is unknown which if any protease degrades IGFBP1.IGFBP2 is enriched in cerebrospinal fluid; its binding inhibits IGF function. IGFBP2 is not significantly degraded in circulation.IGFB3, which binds most IGF in the body is enriched in follicular fluid and found in many other tissues. IGFBP 3 may be cleaved by plasmin, thrombin, Prostate specific Antigen (PSA, KLK3), Matrix Metalloprotease-1 (MMP1), and Matrix Metalloprotease-2 (MMP2). IGFBP3 also binds extracellular matrix and binding lowers its affinity for IGFs. IGFBP3 binding stimulates the effects of IGFs.IGFBP4 acts to inhibit IGF function and is cleaved by Pregnancy associated Plasma Protein A (PAPPA) to release IGF.IGFBP5 is enriched in bone matrix; its binding stimulates IGF function. IGFBP5 is cleaved by Pregnancy Associated Plasma Protein A2 (PAPPA2), ADAM9, complement C1s from smooth muscle, and thrombin. Only the cleavage site for PAPPA2 is known.IGFBP6 is enriched in cerebrospinal fluid. It is unknown which if any protease degrades IGFBP6.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2801	MyD88 cascade initiated on plasma membrane		Mammalian myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is Toll/interleukin (IL)-1 (TIR)-domain containing adapter  protein which plays crucial role in TLR signaling. All TLRs, with only one exception of TLR3, can initiate downstream  signaling trough MyD88. In the MyD88 - dependent pathway, once the adaptor is bound to TLR  it leads to recruitment of IL1 receptor associated kinase family  IRAK which is followed by activation of tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) . TRAF6 is an ubiquitin E3 ligase which in turn induces TGF-beta activating kinase 1 (TAK1) auto phosphorylation. Once activated TAK1 can ultimately mediate the induction of the transcription factor NF-kB or the mitogen-activated protein kinases  (MAPK), such as JNK, p38 and ERK. This results in the translocation of the activated NF-kB and MAPKs to the nucleus and the initiation of appropriate gene transcription leading to the production of many proinflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2804	Hair follicle development: induction - Part 1 of 3		The hair follicle (HF) is the biological unit responsible for producing a single hair shaft. The follicles are arranged with concentric epithelial progenitor layers surrounding the dermal core, which is the dermal papilla (DP). Classically, the development of the follicle itself can be divided into three stages: Induction, [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP2839 Organogenesis] and [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP2840 Cytodifferentiation].In HF development, the induction stage marks the beginning of the crosstalk between epithelium and mesenchyme. Epithelium will result in the placode, which will give origin to most of the layers of the HF. Then, mesenchyme results in the dermal condensate, which thereafter becomes the dermal papilla.The first signal for induction is given by mesenchymal cells expressing WNT. Activation of Wnt signalling pathway blocks β-catenin degradation fate, releasing this transcription factor to start expression of placode formation genes. Between them are MYC, SP5, DKK4, SHH, EDA and EDAR.MYC is related to the differentiation and proliferation of keratinocytes and stem cells migration. SP5 is capable of inhibiting expression of KRT10 and IVL, both associated with epidermal differentiation fate. As a consequence, they may be suppressed to promote placode formation.Dkk molecules have inhibitory effects against Lrp5 and 6, which are crucial co-receptors in the activation of Wnt pathway. Dkk4 acts as Wnt pathway negative feedback loop, fine-tuning this signalling effects on placode shape.SHH expression starts in the induction stage and is also upregulated by Wnt pathway in HF epithelium. Its signal activates Shh signaling pathway in the mesenchyme activating Gli, which induces expression of Ptch, increasing cell sensibility to Shh.Wnt pathway is able to increase EDA expression, whereas Eda pathway does not affect Wnt signal levels. EDAR is a direct Wnt target, and Activin A acts as another upregulator. Furthermore, the Eda-Edar interaction activates NF-kappaB, which upregulates a considerable number of genes, including SHH, DKK4, WNT genes as WNT10A and WNT10B, FOXI3, FGF20, CTGF and FST. WNT10A and WNT10B proteins activate the Wnt pathway in the mesenchymal cells, where released β-catenin activates expression of other Wnts and further upregulates its own expression, maintaining the tissue crosstalk and enhancing the signaling pathway performance.Once the placode has started forming, Eda/NF-kappaB pathway has an important role in guiding cell proliferation. NF-kappaB and Activin A upregulates FOXI3, which has roles in skin appendages shape formation and possibly in placode shape patterning. Other genes also related to placode formation include CDH3 and GJB6, both induced by transcriptional activator TP63.The Eda pathway induces FGF20 expression, which binds to Fgfr1, promoting the dermal condensate aggregative growth, also sustained by Versican (VCAN) expression mediated by mesenchymal Wnt pathway.At induction, strong induction suppressor signals are present, such as Bmp, Fgf7 and Egf and they have to be inhibited. Molecules such as Noggin, Follistatin and CTGF act as BMP signal suppressors. Crucial placodal genes downregulated by BMP are LEF1 and NCAM, but BMP is also capable of inducing early upregulation of differentiation fate transcription factor Msx2.Two other signals Fgf7 and Egf direct differentiation toward the epidermal fate, instead of inducing HF placode formation. These signals persist during induction stage, and their receptors (FGFR1 and EGFR, respectively) are downregulated in the placode to allow the correct HF development.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2805	exRNA mechanism of action and biogenesis		The process of RNA-interference in eukaryotic cells. Long precursor microRNA (miRNA), called pri-miRNA, is cleaved by RNase III endonuclease (Drosha) into pieces of approximately 70 nucleotides each (called pre-miRNA) in the nucleus. Following transportation into the cytoplasm by exportin 5 another RNase III endonuclease (Dicer) cleaves it into mature miRNA segments. Degradation of messenger RNA (mRNA) and translational repression occurs after miRNA binds to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Cytoplasmic long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is cleaved by Dicer into small interfering RNA (siRNA), which is incorporated into RISC, resulting in the cleavage and degradation of specific target mRNA. Synthetic double-stranded siRNA is not processed by Dicer and directly incorporated by the RISC. After cleavage by Dicer, mature miRNAs can also be released out of cells in exosomes, microvesicles or apoptotic bodies, or bond to some high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and Argonaute protein 2 (Ago2). Viral miRNAs exported from the nucleus are processed in the same way.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2805 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2806	Complement system		The complement activation takes place through one or more of the well-established (alternative, classical or lectin) pathways consisting of plasma and membrane-bound proteins. All three pathways converge at the level of complement C3 [https://doi.org/10.6072/H0.MP.A004235.01] and are controlled by regulators [https://doi.org/10.1038/ni.1923]. Complement C3 belongs to the alpha-2-macroglobulin family of proteins, and consists of a alpha-chain and an beta-chain. Cleavage of C3 which can be initiated by one or more of the above three distinct pathways, into C3b[Proteolysis@23-667,749-1663] and C3a [Proteolysis@672-748] is an important step in the complement activation cascade. Classical and lectin pathways, when activated with recognition of pathogens (or immune complexes) use C3-convertase [C4b2a] to cleave complement C3 into C3a and C3b [https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.125.2.359]. However, in alternative pathway a small fraction of the C3 molecules are hydrolyzed to C3(H20) exposing new binding sites. This hydrated C3 [C3(H20)] recruits complement factor B [fB], which is then cleaved by complement factor D [fD] to result in formation of the minor form of C3-convertase [C3(H20)Bb] that cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b [https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.154.3.856]. Further, addition of C3b to C3 convertase [C3bBb or C4b2a] results in C5 convertase [C3bBb3b or C4b2a3b], that cleaves complement C5 to C5a and C5b, is the last enzymatic step of the complement activation cascade [https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.273.27.16828][https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2387864]. During complement activation C5b interacts with complement C6, C7, C8 and C9 in a sequential and non-catalyzed manner to result in the formation of Terminal Complement Complex (TCC) [https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M111.219766]. The entire network is considered as a simple recognition and elimination system of host-immune complexes and apoptotic and/or pathogens, and therefore promotes host immune homeostasis. The complement system is also involved in cross-talk with other processes related to coagulation, lipid metabolism and cancer. However, many pathogens counteract complement attack through a range of different mechanisms, such acquisition of host complement regulators to the surface of pathogen, or secretion of complement inactivation factors. In order to have a holistic view of the entire complement network, Dr. John D.Lambris group (University of Pennsylvania) developed the Complement Map Database (CMAP) which is a unique repository focused on documented molecular interactions described within the complement cascade and between complement and other biological systems. Information contained in CMAP (http://www.complement.us/cmap/index.php)[https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt269] is entirely based on published experimental data and is fully revised by experts in the field. Further, the Signaling Gateway Molecule Pages -SGMP-( https://escholarship.org/uc/molecule_pages)[https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btr190] has published a curated data on each protein involved in human complement activation pathways (refs.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2813	Mammary gland development pathway - Embryonic development (Stage 1 of 4)		The mammary gland development can be subdivided into four stages of development: (1) embryonic development, (2) puberty, (3) pregnancy and lactation and (4) involution. In the embryonic development, a pair of mammary lines (ectoderm) arises, which gives origin to a pair of placodes. Then, each placode penetrates the underlying mesoderm. This results in the formation of the primary mammary gland [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14668814 3].NRG3 is a signal for placode formation. Besides that, it influences cell fate: it binds to its receptor, ERBB4, and induces MYC, which decreases expression of the integrins ITGA6 and ITGB1. The result is a change in cell adhesion and proliferation and consequent exit from the stem cell compartment [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17880691 1].Another process that should be highlighted in the embryonic development is the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). ZEB2 is an EMT regulator. It represses many genes (eg. CCND1, SFRP1, MIR200A, MIR200B, MIR429, TERT, CDH1, CLDN4 and ALPL), and also upregulates mesenchymal markers [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19424592 2]. CCND1 and SFRP1 are related to cell proliferation, and SFRP1 are also related to WNT signaling pathway. MIR200A, MIR200B and MIR429 are microRNAs. TERT is responsible for elongation of telomere ends. CDH1 and CLDN4 are associated with cell adhesion, and ALPL may play a role in skeletal mineralization. Many genes modulate ZEB2. Some of these are shown in the figure [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19424592 2]. TGFB1, TNF and IL1 are cytokines and AKT1 plays a role in many processes like cell proliferation, survival and growth. Hedgehog signals upregulate ZEB2 via TGFB1 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19424592 2].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2814	Mammary gland development pathway - Puberty (Stage 2 of 4)		The primary mammary gland persists until puberty, when it grows and becomes branched. This results in the formation of secondary mammary gland. ESR1 and NRIP1 co-regulates PGR, STAT5A and AREG, which control proliferation and differentiation during mammary gland development. NRIP1 is also required for ductal elongation, in both epithelial and in stromal compartments [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23404106 1]. Estrogen may also execute its growth effect through EGF. Especially, ERBB2, an EGF receptor, may activate or inhibit the growth according to the stage of development. In puberty, ERBB2 impairs the mammary epithelial cell proliferation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11146549 2].AP1 regulates postnatal mammary gland development, mainly in puberty. Some AP1-dependent genes are shown in the figure [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16678816 3]. FOSL1 is a FOS family member. FOS family members dimerize with JUN family members to form AP1 complex. MYC and CCND1 are associated with cell proliferation. VIM is a component of intermediate filaments and FN1 are related to cell adhesion and migration. TIMP1 is a protease inhibitor.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2815	Mammary gland development pathway - Involution (Stage 4 of 4)		After pregnancy and lactation, the mammary gland undergoes a tissue remodeling process, known as involution. This process is characterized by the alveoli degeneration through apoptosis.CHI3L1 inhibits mammary epithelial cell differentiation and polarization in the presence of lactogenic hormones, such as prolactin, hydrocortisone and insulin. CHI3L1 suppress CDH1 and increases MMP9 and this is an important process for involution [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21991364 1].In the SOCS3-STAT3 signaling pathway, STAT5 induces SOCS3, which binds to its receptor, IL6ST. Then, IL6ST activates STAT3 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16231422 2]. SOCS3/STAT3 signaling pathway is associated with MYC and, thereafter, with MYC target genes such as TP53, BAX and E2F1. Changes in the SOCS3/STAT3 signaling pathway affect MYC. As SOCS3 has an anti-apoptotic function and MYC an apoptotic function, SOCS3 is considered an important regulator of involution [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17377501 3].		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2817	Mammary gland development pathway - Pregnancy and lactation (Stage 3 of 4)		The secondary mammary gland can be inactive or active. It becomes active during pregnancy and lactation, when there is a formation of alveoli, the structure responsible for milk production. There are four signal inputs for the mammary gland development during pregnancy and lactation: (1) prolactin receptor (PRLR), (2) epidermal growth factor receptors (ERBB1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ERBB4), (3) estrogen receptors (ESR1 and ESR2) and (4) progesterone receptor (PGR).In the first case, PRL binds to PRLR, allowing its phosphorylation by JAK2, and the consequent coupling of STAT5 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16231422 1]. JAK2 phosphorylates STAT5, allowing its migration to nucleus. STAT5 target genes are related to proliferation (TNFSF11, CCND1), differentiation (CSN2, WFDC, ELF5, GJB2) and survival (BCL2L1) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16231422 1]. CEBPA and CEBPB are related to the balance between proliferation and differentiation of epithelial cells [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9513715 2]. The TNFSF11/ TNFRSF11A pathway is associated with proliferation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16231422 1]. MYC, galanin and PTPN1 are regulators of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway and UFS are implicated in cell cycle control [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16231422 1] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15689376 3] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12907752 4] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23154416 5].In the second case, NRG binds to one of its receptors (ERBB1, ERBB2, ERBB3 or ERBB4) and the signal is transmitted  by ERBB4  to  STAT5, from where it follows as described above [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16231422 1]. ERBB4 substitutes JAK2 by phosphorylating STAT5.Finally, in the last two cases, estrogen binds to its receptors, ESR1 and ESR2, and stimulates PGR [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16231422 1]. ESR1, ESR2 and PGR are associated with proliferation. ESR1 also affects adhesion through induction of TTC9, which interacts with TPM3 (a protein associated with actin filaments), playing a role in involution [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22917536 6].PNCK appears to negatively regulate EGFR and MAPK signaling during pregnancy [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18562482 7]. ATP2C2 is co-expressed with the component of Calcium influx channel encoded by ORAI1.  Together, they regulate Ca2+ uptake, influencing differentiation and supporting the large calcium transport requirements for milk secretion during lactation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23840669 8].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2821	Transcriptional regulation of pluripotent stem cells		Pluripotent stem cells are undifferentiated cells posessing an abbreviated cell cycle (reviewed in Stein et al. 2012), a characteristic profile of gene expression (Rao et al. 2004, Kim et al. 2006, Player et al. 2006, Wang et al 2006 using mouse, International Stem Cell Initiative 2007, Assou et al. 2007, Assou et al. 2009, Ding et al. 2012 using mouse), and the ability to self-renew and generate all cell types of the body except extraembryonic lineages (Marti et al. 2013, reviewed in Romeo et al. 2012). They are a major cell type in the inner cell mass of the early embryo in vivo, and cells with the same properties, induced pluripotent stem cells, can be generated in vitro from differentiated adult cells by overexpression of a set of transcription factor genes (Takahashi and Yamanaka 2006, Takahashi et al. 2007, Yu et al. 2007, Jaenisch and Young 2008, Stein et al. 2012, reviewed in Dejosez and Zwaka 2012).<br>Pluripotency is maintained by a self-reinforcing loop of transcription factors (Boyer et al. 2005, Rao et al. 2006, Matoba et al. 2006, Player et al. 2006, Babaie et al. 2007, Sun et al. 2008, Assou et al. 2009, reviewed in Kashyap et al. 2009, reviewed in Dejosez and Zwaka 2012). In vivo, initiation of pluripotency may depend on maternal factors transmitted through the oocyte (Assou et al. 2009) and on DNA demethylation in the zygote (recently reviewed in Seisenberger et al. 2013) and hypoxia experienced by the blastocyst in the reproductive tract before implantation (Forristal et al. 2010, reviewed in Mohyeldin et al. 2010). In vitro, induced pluripotency may initiate with demethylation and activation of the promoters of POU5F1 (OCT4) and NANOG (Bhutani et al. 2010). Hypoxia also significantly enhances conversion to pluripotent stem cells (Yoshida et al. 2009). POU5F1 and NANOG, together with SOX2, encode central factors in pluripotency and activate their own transcription (Boyer et al 2005, Babaie et al. 2007, Yu et al. 2007, Takahashi et al. 2007). The autoactivation loop maintains expression of POU5F1, NANOG, and SOX2 at high levels in stem cells and, in turn, complexes containing various combinations of these factors (Remenyi et al. 2003, Lam et al. 2012) activate the expression of a group of genes whose products are associated with rapid cell proliferation and repress the expression of a group of genes whose products are associated with cell differentiation (Boyer et al. 2005, Matoba et al. 2006, Babaie et al. 2007, Chavez et al. 2009, Forristal et al. 2010, Guenther 2011).<br>Comparisons between human and mouse embryonic stem cells must be made with caution and for this reason inferences from mouse have been used sparingly in this module. Human ESCs more closely resemble mouse epiblast stem cells in having inactivated X chromosomes, flattened morphology, and intolerance to passaging as single cells (Hanna et al. 2010). Molecularly, human ESCs differ from mouse ESCs in being maintained by FGF and Activin/Nodal/TGFbeta signaling rather than by LIF and canonical Wnt signaling (Greber et al. 2010, reviewed in Katoh 2011). In human ESCs POU5F1 binds and directly activates the FGF2 gene, however Pou5f1 does not activate Fgf2 in mouse ESCs (reviewed in De Los Angeles et al. 2012). Differences in expression patterns of KLF2, KLF4, KLF5, ESRRB, FOXD3, SOCS3, LIN28, NODAL were observed between human and mouse ESCs (Cai et al. 2010) as were differences in expression of EOMES, ARNT and several other genes (Ginis et al.2004).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2824	Detoxification of reactive oxygen species		Reactive oxygen species such as superoxide (O2.-), peroxides (ROOR), singlet oxygen, peroxynitrite (ONOO-), and hydroxyl radical (OH.) are generated by cellular processes such as respiration (reviewed in Murphy 2009, Brand 2010) and redox enzymes and are required for signaling yet they are damaging due to their high reactivity (reviewed in Imlay 2008, Buettner 2011, Kavdia 2011, Birben et al. 2012, Ray et al. 2012). Aerobic cells have defenses that detoxify reactive oxygen species by converting them to less reactive products. Superoxide dismutases convert superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen (reviewed in Fukai and Ushio-Fukai 2011). Catalase and peroxidases then convert hydrogen peroxide to water.<br>Humans contain 3 superoxide dismutases: SOD1 is located in the cytosol and mitochondrial intermembrane space, SOD2 is located in the mitochondrial matrix, and SOD3 is located in the extracellular region. Superoxide, a negative ion, is unable to easily cross membranes and tends to remain in the compartment where it was produced. Hydrogen peroxide, one of the products of superoxide dismutase, is able to diffuse across membranes and pass through aquaporin channels. In most cells the primary source of hydrogen peroxide is mitochondria and, once in the cytosol, hydrogen peroxide serves as a signaling molecule to regulate redox-sensitive proteins such as transcription factors, kinases, phosphatases, ion channels, and others (reviewed in Veal and Day 2011, Ray et al. 2012). Hydrogen peroxide is decomposed to water by catalase, decomposed to water plus oxidized thioredoxin by peroxiredoxins, and decomposed to water plus oxidized glutathione by glutathione peroxidases (Presnell et al. 2013).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2828	Bladder cancer		The urothelium covers the luminal surface of almost the entire urinary tract, extending from the renal pelvis, through the ureter and bladder, to the proximal urethra. The majority of urothelial carcinoma are bladder carcinomas, and urothelial carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter account for only approximately 7% of the total. Urothelial tumours arise and evolve through divergent phenotypic pathways. Some tumours progress from urothelial hyperplasia to low-grade non-invasive superficial papillary tumours. More aggressive variants arise either from flat, high-grade carcinoma in situ (CIS) and progress to invasive tumours, or they arise de novo as invasive tumours. Low-grade papillary tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. In contrast, CIS and invasive tumors frequently show alterations in the TP53 and RB genes and pathways. Invasion and metastases are promoted by several factors that alter the tumour microenvironment, including the aberrant expression of  E-cadherins (E-cad), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

Regulatory interactions are shown as activating or repressing arrows. Broken lines indicate that the interaction is simulated only in an even more course-grained manner than the other gene regulatory reactions. NICD, which originates through cleavage reactions following DLL1 ligand binding to the NOTCH1 receptor, was assigned a separate symbol to clarify that only the intracellular domain of the Notch receptor acts in the nucleus as a transcription (co)-factor. The (weak) modulating action of LFNG on D/N signaling is shown as dashed lines - (red for the case of inhibiting action, green for the case of a positive effect on the D/N reaction rate.) Arrows pointing to the symbol for the empty set designate decay reactions of a species. We suppressed them for all species' decays except for those decay rates that we assume as controlled by signal transduction pathways. This applies also to the removal of DLL1 and NOTCH1 from the membrane after their binding, resulting in NOTCH1 cleavage and NICD split-off.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2854 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP286	IL-3 signaling pathway		Interleukin 3 (IL-3) is a potent growth factor belonging to the super family of cytokines. IL-3 is a 20- 32kDa glycoprotein involved in the process of hematopoiesis. It is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of pleuripotent hematopoietic stem cells, progenitor cells and their mature progeny. IL-3 is a growth factor for B lymphocytes. It also activates monocytes and augments survival and propagation of mast cells, eosinophils and stromal cells. IL-3 is secreted predominantly by activated T lymphocytes in response to immunological stimuli and to a lesser extent by mast cells and eosinophils. IL-3 exerts influence on different biological activities, primarily hematopoiesis by associating with the IL-3 receptor. This receptor is a heterodimeric complex and consists of an alpha chain- IL3RA and a beta chain CSF2RB, shared with the receptors for granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor and Interleukin-5. When IL-3 binds to CSF2RB receptor, adapter proteins like SHC1, GRB2 and SOS1 are recruited to activate HRAS. HRAS stimulates RAF1 which further activates MAP2K1 and finally MAPK1 and MAPK3. The signals generated through this pathway are then transmitted to the nucleus leading to the activation of various transcription factors such as JUN and FOS which are involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. IL-3 mediated activation of HRAS also inhibits apoptosis through phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase/ AKT pathway. The activation of AKT1 in response to IL-3 stimulation leads to the phosphorylation of the apoptotic regulator, BCL2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD), its binding to 14-3-3 and sequestration into the cytoplasm. IL-3 stimulation activates Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) by its phosphorylation. JAK2 in turn phosphorylates signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A and 5B. These translocate to the nucleus, serving the purpose of transcription factor for early genes as well as a feedback inhibitor of the JAK-STAT pathway. IL-3, in addition, is known to activate various tyrosine kinases such as LYN, FYN, SRC, SYK, TEC1 and HCK. The interactions and intersections between canonical and noncanonical IL-3 signaling systems are depicted in the pathway map.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_3_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

A high fat diet will cause megakaryocytes to produce platelets with an increase in both inflammatory and thrombotic genes. IL1-beta in circulation as a result of increased body weight will bind IL1R1 on megakaryocytes. This interaction leads to the activation of the nuclear factor (NF)kB, PI3K/Akt, and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) (ERK and p38) pathways. As a result, there is an increase in megakarycoyte maturation, including increased adhesion, increases in ploidy, and increases in mRNA production of inflammatory and thrombotic genes. IL1-beta can also bind IL1R1 on platelets and either enhance aggregation induced by agonists or promote adhesion and heterotypic aggregate formation.Some of the data used to create the pathway was generated in mouse (noted in pathway), however the pathway represents human homologs of those genes.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2865 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2868	TCA cycle nutrient use and invasiveness of ovarian cancer		Schematic showing the shift in nutrient utilization in TCA cycle with increasing degree of invasiveness. Low-invasive ovarian cancer (OVCA) cells are glucose dependent for their TCA cycle pool. With increasing invasiveness in cancer cells, dominant nutrient which feeds the TCA cycle shifts from glucose to Gln. In high-invasive OVCA cells, Gln dominates the TCA cycle. In low-invasive OVCA cells, glucose activates Jak1, which activates STAT3 by tyrosine phosphorylation, thereby regulating glycolysis in cancer cells. In highinvasive OVCA cells, besides glucose's role in activating STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, glutamine activates JAK1 through TCA cycle to further activate STAT3 by tyrosine phosphorylation and thus regulate glycolysis. Further, Gln activates Erk1/2, which subsequently activates STAT3 by serine phosphorylation selectively in high-invasive OVCA cells. The serine phosphorylation of STAT3 enhances oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria by interaction with mitochondrial complexes I and II, thereby increasing TCA cycle activity in high-invasive OVCA cells.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2882	Nuclear receptors meta-pathway		In the field of molecular biology, nuclear receptors are a class of proteins found within cells that are responsible for sensing steroid and thyroid hormones and certain other molecules. In response, these receptors work with other proteins to regulate the expression of specific genes, thereby controlling the development, homeostasis, and metabolism of the organism.Nuclear receptors have the ability to directly bind to DNA and regulate the expression of adjacent genes, hence these receptors are classified as transcription factors. The regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptors generally only happens when a ligand is present. More specifically, ligand binding to a nuclear receptor results in a conformational change in the receptor, which, in turn, activates the receptor, resulting in up- or down-regulation of gene expression.A unique property of nuclear receptors that differentiates them from other classes of receptors is their ability to directly interact with and control the expression of genomic DNA. As a consequence, nuclear receptors play key roles in both embryonic development and adult homeostasis. Nuclear receptors may be classified according to either mechanism or homology.[From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia]		9606

The left half of this pathway illustrates pathways of myometrial relaxation that are active throughout normal gestation. These signaling events act to suppress coordinated contractions to prevent the early onset of labor at term, largely via activation of the adenylyl-cyclase thrhough G-protein coupled receptors. On the right side of this pathway are signaling componets involved in the activation of uterine contractions at labor, in particular, activation of calcium mobilization via Oxytocin mediated binding to the Oxytocin G-protein coupled receptor. Additional genes implicated in this pathway, based on microarray expression profiling of gestation, term and postpartum of term mice are also included (e.g., Guca2b, Rdc1, Edg2) have also been included.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2942	DDX1 as a regulatory component of the Drosha microprocessor		Posttranscriptional maturation is a critical step in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis that determines mature miRNA levels. In addition to core components (Drosha and DGCR8 [DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8]) in the microprocessor, regulatory RNA-binding proteins may confer the specificity for recruiting and processing of individual primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs). Here, we identify DDX1 as a regulatory protein that promotes the expression of a subset of miRNAs, including five members in the microRNA-200 (miR-200) family and four miRNAs in an eight-miRNA signature of a mesenchymal ovarian cancer subtype. A majority of DDX1-dependent miRNAs are induced after DNA damage. This induction is facilitated by the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-mediated phosphorylation of DDX1. Inhibiting DDX1 promotes ovarian tumor growth and metastasis in a syngeneic mouse model. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reveals that low DDX1 levels are associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with serous ovarian cancer. These findings suggest that DDX1 is a key modulator in miRNA maturation and ovarian tumor suppression.This pathway is based on the graphical abstract from http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/abstract/S2211-1247(14)00660-3.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2942 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP299	Nuclear receptors in lipid metabolism and toxicity		Nuclear receptors are transcription factors that are activated upon binding to its ligands. Initially, they had been classified as classic endocrine nuclear hormone receptors and orphan receptors. However, further studies have led to the identification of lipid ligands for some of these adopted orphan receptors, which are responsible for lipid metabolism, storage or elimination. One of the characteristics of these receptors is that they act by forming heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR). The receptors include peroxisome proliferators-Activated receptors (PPARs) for fatty acids, liver X receptor (LCR) for oxysterols, Farnesoid X receptors (FXR) for bile acids and steroid xenobiotic receptor/X receptor (SXR/PXR or Nsil2) for xenobiotics. Other orphan receptors also require RXR for its functions are vitamin D receptor (VDR) for vitamin D and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) for retinoid acids, although these receptors are not involved in lipid metabolism. Upon binding to various ligands, three classes of proteins are synthesized including lipid binding proteins, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and cytochrome P450 member proteins which catalyzes lipid anabolism, metabolism and elimination.In addition to lipid metabolism, some members of the cytochrome P450 family genes are responsible for activation of procarcinogens, detoxification of environmental toxins and metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics. In particular, CAR, Nsil2 and recently identified VDR are important in up-regulation of these cytochromes. Of all the human cytochrome P450 genes, only a few CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 account for most toxicity effects, specifically CYP3A is responsible for clearing approximately half of the clinically prescribed drugs. For instance, acetaminophen, one of the most commonly used drug, is toxic in high doses due to the activation of CAR and the drugs subsequent conversion to acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) by CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and CYP3A.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3	Transcriptional activation by NRF2 in response to phytochemicals		Based on [http://www.nature.com/nrc/journal/v3/n10/fig_tab/nrc1189_F4.html Surh, 2003, figure 4].NRF2 is a transcription factor that regulates expression of many detoxification or antioxidant enzymes. The Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) is a cytoplasmic repressor of NRF2 that inhibits its ability to translocate to the nucleus. These two proteins interact with each other through the double glycine-rich domains of KEAP1 and a hydrophilic region in the NEH2 domain of NRF2. KEAP1 contains many cysteine residues. Phase II enzyme inducers and/or prooxidants can cause oxidation or covalent modification (R) of these cysteine residues. As a result, NRF2 is released from KEAP1. In addition, phosphorylation of NRF2 at serine (S) and threonine (T) residues by kinases such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase C (PKC), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is assumed to facilitate the dissociation of NRF2 from KEAP1 and subsequent translocation to the nucleus. p38 can both stimulate and inhibit the NRF2 nuclear translocation. In the nucleus, NRF2 associates with small MAF (the term is derived from musculoaponeurotic-fibrosarcoma virus), forming a heterodimer that binds to the antioxidant-responsive element (ARE) to stimulate gene expression. NRF2/MAF target genes encode phase II detoxification or antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione S-transferase alpha2 (GSTA2), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), gamma-glutamate cysteine ligase (gamma -GCLC and gamma -GCLM) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). PI3K also phosphorylates the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-beta (C/EBPbeta), inducing its translocation to the nucleus and binding to the CCAAT sequence of C/EBP-beta response element within the xenobiotic response element (XRE), in conjunction with NRF2 binding to ARE. Transfection of human neuroblastoma cells with PI3K activates ARE, which is attenuated by a pharmacological inhibitor of PI3K or dominant-negative NRF2. Curcumin and caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) disrupt the NRF2–KEAP1 complex, leading to increased NRF2 binding to ARE. Sulphoraphane directly interacts with KEAP1 by covalent binding to its thiol groups. 6-(Methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate (6-HITC) — a sulphoraphane analogue from Japanese horseradish wasabi — stimulates nuclear translocation of NRF2, which subsequently activates ARE. Protein phosphorylation sites were added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus (R), www.phosphosite.org.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP304	Kit receptor signaling pathway		Kit is a cytokine receptor that belongs to the type III receptor tyrosine kinase family. It is structurally similar to platelet-derived growth factor recpetors (PDGFRs), colony stimulating factor-1 receptor and fms-like tyrosine kinase. Kit signaling is plays important role in a number of physiological processes including erythropoiesis, lymphopoiesis, mast cell development and function, megakaryopoiesis, gametogenesis and melanogenesis. Sequence alterations in the c-kit gene are found to be associated with different cancers including hematopoietic malignancies, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, germ cell tumors, small-cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. The primary ligand for kit receptor is stem cell factor (SCF). It is also known as Kit ligand, steel factor or mast cell growth factor. SCF is a glycosylated, non-covalent homodimer. Alternative splicing and proteolytic cleavage results in soluble and membrane bound forms of the protein. that binds to two KIT monomers. Binding of SCF to KIT results in the dimerization of the receptor and its autophsphorylation. The residues that are known to get phosphorylated upon ligand binding include Tyr568, Tyr570, Tyr703, Tyr721, Tyr730, Tyr823, Tyr 900 and Tyr936. Signaling events downstream of the KIT receptor are well studied. Among the signaling cascades that are activated are the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK and the PI3K/AKT/RPS6K pathways. KIT stimulation is also known to activate the JAK/STAT and PLC/PKC signaling pathways. Among the other key proteins that are regulated by KIT are the kinases BTK, TEC, LYN, SRC, FYN and JNK. Regulation of KIT receptor tyrosine kinase occurs through many mechanisms. Activated KIT receptors are degraded via CBL, a E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. CBL induces the degradation of the receptor via the proteasome or lysosome. KIT can also be dephosphorylated and inactivated by the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp1. Also, activation of protein kinase C results in a negative feedback loop, wherein it phosphorylates specific serine residues leading to the inactivation of KIT.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP306	Focal adhesion		Cell-matrix adhesions play essential roles in important biological processes including cell motility, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, regulation of gene expression and cell survival. At the cell-extracellular matrix contact points, specialized structures are formed and termed focal adhesions, where bundles of actin filaments are anchored to transmembrane receptors of the integrin family through a multi-molecular complex of junctional plaque proteins. Some of the constituents of focal adhesions participate in the structural link between membrane receptors and the actin cytoskeleton, while others are signalling molecules, including different protein kinases and phosphatases, their substrates, and various adapter proteins. Integrin signaling is dependent upon the non-receptor tyrosine kinase activities of the FAK and src proteins as well as the adaptor protein functions of FAK, src and Shc to initiate downstream signaling events. These signalling events culminate in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton; a prerequisite for changes in cell shape and motility, and gene expression. Similar morphological alterations and modulation of gene expression are initiated by the binding of growth factors to their respective receptors, emphasizing the considerable crosstalk between adhesion- and growth factor-mediated signalling.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP306 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3286	Copper homeostasis		"Copper is a redox-active transition metal and an essential trace element for life. It is a catalytic cofactor for numerous enzymes involved in critical biological processes (eg. detoxyfication by oxygen free radicals, angiogenesis, pigmentation, peptide hormone production, etc.). However, ""free"" copper is harmful for cells because can generate ROS that leads to cellular damage. Thus, all organisms and cells maintain a tight control of its uptake, trafficking and export. This process is rather intricate and requires an interplay between numerous biomolecules (proteins, enzymes, metabolites...) that act as copper ions importers (CTR1, CTR2, DMT1, Prp, APP), chaperones (CCS, ATOX1, COX17, COMMD1) and exporters (ATP7A, ATP7B). Copper ions and Cu-indipendent stimuli (hormone, oxygen, phosphorylation and ubiquination) seem to affect localization and expression of Cu-transporters and chaperones. Potential target of copper ions seem to be crucial signaling pathways, such PI3K/Akt, in which copper induces insulin-like effects. Copper dyshomeostasis could be implicated in cancer and a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, prion disease and ALS.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3286 CPTAC Assay Portal]"		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3287	Overview of nanoparticle effects		This pathway is giving a summary of currently known nanoparticle effects on cells and organisms. Although there is currently no nanoparticle-specific effect known, there is a cascade of effects triggered if cells or organisms are exposed to nanoparticles: The most abundantly observed event is oxidative stress which causes DNA damage, protein and lipid oxidation, and cell death. The mere overload of nanoparticles in the vesicular system leads to cytoskeleton and cell adhesion problems and interfere with the cell's autophagic system. Some specific nanoparticles are reported to interfere with the cell membrane, others stimulate the blood coagulation system. The release of metal ions from specific nanoparticles challenges the metal disposal system of the cell.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3305	NoRC negatively regulates rRNA expression		The Nucleolar Remodeling Complex (NoRC) comprising TIP5 (BAZ2A) and the chromatin remodeller SNF2H (SMARCA5) silences rRNA gene (reviewed in Santoro and Grummt 2001, Grummt 2007, Preuss and Pikaard 2007, Birch and Zommerdijk 2008, McStay and Grummt 2008, Grummt and Langst 2013). The TAM domain of TIP5 (BAZ2A) binds promoter-associated RNA (pRNA) transcribed from the intergenic spacer region of rDNA. The pRNA bound by TIP5 is required to direct the complex to the main promoter of the rRNA gene possibly by triple helix formation between pRNA and the rDNA. The PHD domain of TIP5 binds histone H4 acetylated at lysine-16. Transcription Termination Factor-I (TTF-I) binds to a promoter-proximal terminator (T0 site) in the rDNA and interacts with the TIP5 subunit of NoRC. NoRC also interacts with the SIN3-HDAC complex, HDAC1, HDAC2, DNMT1, and DNMT3B. DNMT3B interacts with a triple helix formed by pRNA and the rDNA. HDAC1, DNMT1, and DNMT3B have been shown to be required for proper DNA methylation of silenced rRNA gene copies, although the catalytic activity of DNMT3B was not required.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3306	Aflatoxin activation and detoxification		Aflatoxins are among the principal mycotoxins produced as secondary metabolites by the molds Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus that contaminate economically important food and feed crops (Wild & Turner 2002). Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is the most potent naturally occurring carcinogen known and is also an immunosuppressant. It is a potent hepatocarcinogenic agent in many species, and has been implicated in the etiology of human hepatocellular carcinoma. Poultry, especially turkeys, are extremely sensitive to the toxic and carcinogenic action of AFB1 present in animal feed, resulting in multi-million dollar losses to the industry. Discerning the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of this extreme sensitivity of poultry to AFB1 will help with the development of new strategies to increase aflatoxin resistance (Rawal et al. 2010, Diaz & Murcia 2011).<br><br><br>AFB1 has one major genotoxic metabolic fate, conversion to AFXBO, and several others that are less mutagenic but that can still be quite toxic. AFB1 can be oxidised to the toxic AFB1 exo 8,9 epoxide (AFXBO) product by several cytochrome P450 enzymes, especially P450 3A4 in the liver. This 8,9 epoxide can react with the N7 atom of a guanyl base of DNA to produce adducts by intercalating between DNA base pairs. The exo epoxide is unstable in solution, however, and can react spontaneously to form a diol that is no longer reactive with DNA. The diol product in turn undergoes base-catalysed rearrangement to a dialdehyde that can react with protein lysine residues. AFB1 can also be metabolised to products (AFQ1, AFM1, AFM1E) which have far less genotoxic consequences than AFB1. The main route of detoxification of AFB1 is conjugation of its reactive 8,9-epoxide form with glutathione (GSH). This reaction is carried out by trimeric glutathione transferases (GSTs), providing a chemoprotective mechanism against toxicity. Glutathione conjugates are usually excreted as mercapturic acids in urine (Guengerich et al. 1998, Hamid et al. 2013). The main metabolic routes of aflatoxin in humans are described here.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3307	MAPK6/MAPK4 signaling		MAPK6 and MAPK4 (also known as ERK3 and ERK4) are vertebrate-specific atypical MAP kinases.  Atypical MAPK are less well characterized than their conventional counterparts, and are generally classified as such based on their lack of activation by MAPKK family members. Unlike the conventional MAPK proteins, which contain a Thr-X-Tyr motif in the activation loop, MAPK6 and 4 have a single Ser-Glu-Gly phospho-acceptor motif (reviewed in Coulombe and Meloche, 2007; Cargnello et al, 2011).  MAPK6 is also distinct in being an unstable kinase, whose turnover is mediated by ubiquitin-dependent degradation (Coulombe et al, 2003; Coulombe et al, 2004). The biological functions and pathways governing MAPK6 and 4 are not well established.  MAPK6 and 4 are phosphorylated downstream of class I p21 activated kinases (PAKs) in a RAC- or CDC42-dependent manner (Deleris et al, 2008; Perander et al, 2008; Deleris et al, 2011; De La Mota-Peynado et al, 2011). One of the only well established substrates of MAPK6 and 4 is MAPKAPK5, which contributes to cell motility by promoting the HSBP1-dependent rearrangement of F-actin (Gerits et al, 2007; Kostenko et al, 2009a; reviewed in Kostenko et al, 2011b).  The atypical MAPKs also contribute to cell motility and invasiveness through the NCOA3:ETV4-dependent regulation of MMP gene expression (Long et al, 2012; Yan et al, 2008; Qin et al, 2008).  Both of these pathways may be misregulated in human cancers (reviewed in Myant and Sansom, 2011; Kostenko et al, 2012) View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=5687128 Reactome].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3308	Oncogene Induced Senescence		Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is triggered by high level of RAS/RAF/MAPK signaling that can be caused, for example, by oncogenic mutations in RAS or RAF proteins, or by oncogenic mutations in growth factor receptors, such as EGFR, that act upstream of RAS/RAF/MAPK cascade. Oncogene-induced senescence can also be triggered by high transcriptional activity of E2F1, E2F2 or E2F3 which can be caused, for example, by the loss-of-function of RB1 tumor suppressor.<br><br>Oncogenic signals trigger transcription of CDKN2A locus tumor suppressor genes: p16INK4A and p14ARF. p16INK4A and p14ARF share exons 2 and 3, but are expressed from different promoters and use different reading frames (Quelle et al. 1995). Therefore, while their mRNAs are homologous and are both translationally inhibited by miR-24 microRNA (Lal et al. 2008, To et al. 2012), they share no similarity at the amino acid sequence level and perform distinct functions in the cell. p16INK4A acts as the inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 which phosphorylate and inhibit RB1 protein thereby promoting G1 to S transition and cell cycle progression (Serrano et al. 1993). Increased p16INK4A level leads to hypophosphorylation of RB1, allowing RB1 to inhibit transcription of E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3-target genes that are needed for cell cycle progression, which results in cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. p14-ARF binds and destabilizes MDM2 ubiquitin ligase (Zhang et al. 1998), responsible for ubiquitination and degradation of TP53 (p53) tumor suppressor protein (Wu et al. 1993, Fuchs et al. 1998, Fang et al. 2000). Therefore, increased p14-ARF level leads to increased level of TP53 and increased expression of TP53 target genes, such as p21, which triggers p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and, depending on other factors, may also lead to p53-mediated apoptosis. CDKN2B locus, which encodes an inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6, p15INK4B, is located in the vicinity of CDKN2A locus, at the chromosome band 9p21. p15INK4B, together with p16INK4A, contributes to senescence of human T-lymphocytes (Erickson et al. 1998) and mouse fibroblasts (Malumbres et al. 2000). SMAD3, activated by TGF-beta-1 signaling, controls senescence in the mouse multistage carcinogenesis model through regulation of MYC and p15INK4B gene expression (Vijayachandra et al. 2003). TGF-beta-induced p15INK4B expression is also important for the senescence of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (Senturk et al. 2010).<p>MAP kinases MAPK1 (ERK2) and MAPK3 (ERK1), which are activated by RAS signaling, phosphorylate ETS1 and ETS2 transcription factors in the nucleus (Yang et al. 1996, Seidel et al. 2002, Foulds et al. 2004, Nelson et al. 2010). Phosphorylated ETS1 and ETS2 are able to bind RAS response elements (RREs) in the CDKN2A locus and stimulate p16INK4A transcription (Ohtani et al. 2004). At the same time, activated ERKs (MAPK1 i.e. ERK2 and MAPK3 i.e. ERK1) phosphorylate ERF, the repressor of ETS2 transcription, which leads to translocation of ERF to the cytosol and increased transcription of ETS2 (Sgouras et al. 1995, Le Gallic et al. 2004). ETS2 can be sequestered and inhibited by binding to ID1, resulting in inhibition of p16INK4A transcription (Ohtani et al. 2004).<br><br>Transcription of p14ARF is stimulated by binding of E2F transcription factors (E2F1, E2F2 or E2F3) in complex with SP1 to p14ARF promoter (Parisi et al. 2002).<br><br>Oncogenic RAS signaling affects mitochondrial metabolism through an unknown mechanism, leading to increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which triggers oxidative stress induced senescence pathway. In addition, increased rate of cell division that is one of the consequences of oncogenic signaling, leads to telomere shortening which acts as another senescence trigger.<br>While OIS has been studied to considerable detail in cultured cells, establishment of in vivo role of OIS has been difficult due to lack of specific biomarkers and its interconnectedness with other senescence pathways (Baek and Ryeom 2017, reviewed in Sharpless and Sherr 2015).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3309	EPH-Ephrin signaling		During the development process cell migration and adhesion are the main forces involved in morphing the cells into critical anatomical structures. The ability of a cell to migrate to its correct destination depends heavily on signaling at the cell membrane. Erythropoietin producing hepatocellular carcinoma (EPH) receptors and their ligands, the ephrins (EPH receptors interacting proteins, EFNs), orchestrates the precise control necessary to guide a cell to its destination. They are expressed in all tissues of a developing embryo and are involved in multiple developmental processes such as axon guidance, cardiovascular and skeletal development and tissue patterning. In addition, EPH receptors and EFNs are expressed in developing and mature synapses in the nervous system, where they may have a role in regulating synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation. Activation of EPHB receptors in neurons induces the rapid formation and enlargement of dendritic spines, as well as rapid synapse maturation (Dalva et al. 2007). On the other hand, EPHA4 activation leads to dendritic spine elimination (Murai et al. 2003, Fu et al. 2007).<br>EPH receptors are the largest known family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), with fourteen total receptors divided into either A- or B-subclasses: EPHA (1-8 and 10) and EPHB (1-4 and 6). EPH receptors can have overlapping functions, and loss of one receptor can be partially compensated for by another EPH receptor that has similar expression pattern and ligand-binding specificities. EPH receptors have an N-terminal extracellular domain through which they bind to ephrin ligands, a short transmembrane domain, and an intracellular cytoplasmic signaling structure containing a canonical tyrosine kinase catalytic domain as well as other protein interaction sites. Ephrins are also sub-divided into an A-subclass (A1-A5), which are tethered to the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, and a B-subclass (B1-B3), members of which have a transmembrane domain and a short, highly conserved cytoplasmic tail lacking endogenous catalytic activity. The interaction between EPH receptors and its ligands requires cell-cell interaction since both molecules are membrane-bound. Close contact between EPH receptors and EFNs is required for signaling to occur. EPH/EFN-initiated signaling occurs bi-directionally into either EPH- or EFN-expressing cells or axons. Signaling into the EPH receptor-expressing cell is referred as the forward signal and signaling into the EFN-expressing cell, the reverse signal.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3310	Mitochondrial translation		Of the roughly 1000 human mitochondrial proteins only 13 proteins, all of them hydrophobic inner membrane proteins that are components of the oxidative phosphorylation apparatus, are encoded in the mitochondrial genome and translated by mitoribosomes at the matrix face of the inner membrane (reviewed in Herrmann et al. 2012, Hallberg and Larsson 2014, Lightowlers et al. 2014). The remainder, including all proteins of the mitochondrial translation system, are encoded in the nucleus and imported from the cytosol into the mitochondrion. Translation in the mitochondrion reflects both the bacterial origin of the organelle and subsequent divergent evolution during symbiosis (reviewed in Huot et al. 2014, Richman et al. 2014). Human mitochondrial ribosomes have a low sedimentation coefficient of only 55S, but at 2.71 MDa they retain a similar mass to E. coli 70S particles. The 55S particles are protein-rich compared to both cytosolic ribosomes and eubacterial ribosomes. This is due to shorter mt-rRNAs, mitochondria-specific proteins, and numerous rearrangements in individual protein positions within the two ribosome subunits (inferred from bovine ribosomes in Sharma et al. 2003, Greber et al. 2014, Kaushal et al. 2014, reviewed in Agrawal and Sharma 2012).<br>Mitochondrial mRNAs have either no untranslated leader or short leaders of 1-3 nucleotides, with the exception of the 2 bicistronic transcripts, RNA7 and RNA14, which have overlapping orfs that encode ND4L/ND4 and ATP8/ATP6 respectively. Translation is believed to initiate with the mRNA binding the 28S subunit:MTIF3 (28S subunit:IF-3Mt, 28S subunit:IF2mt) complex together with MTIF2:GTP (IF-2Mt:GTP, IF2mt:GTP) at the matrix face of the inner membrane (reviewed in Christian and Spremulli 2012). MTIF3 can dissociate 55S particles in preparation for initiation, enhances formation of initiation complexes, and inhibits N-formylmethionine-tRNA (fMet-tRNA) binding to 28S subunits in the absence of mRNA. Binding of fMet-tRNA to the start codon of the mRNA results in a stable complex while absence of a start codon at the 5' end of the mRNA causes eventual dissociation of the mRNA from the 28S subunit. After recognition of a start codon, the 39S subunit then binds the stable complex, GTP is hydrolyzed, and the initiation factors MTIF3 and MTIF2:GDP dissociate.<br>Translation elongation then proceeds by cycles of aminoacyl-tRNAs binding, peptide bond formation, and displacement of deacylated tRNAs. In each cycle an aminoacyl-tRNA in a complex with TUFM:GTP (EF-Tu:GTP) binds at the A-site of the ribosome, GTP is hydrolyzed, and TUFM:GDP dissociates. The elongating polypeptide bonded to the tRNA at the P-site is transferred to the aminoacyl group at the A-site by peptide bond formation at the peptidyl transferase center, leaving a deacylated tRNA at the P-site and the elongating polypeptide attached to the tRNA at the A-site. The polypeptide is co-translationally inserted into the inner mitochondrial membrane via an interaction with OXA1L (Haque et al. 2010, reviewed in Ott and Hermann 2010). After peptide bond formation, GFM1:GTP (EF-Gmt:GTP) then binds the ribosome complex, GTP is hydrolyzed, GFM1:GDP dissociates, and the ribosome translocates 3 nucleotides in the 3' direction along the mRNA, relocating the polypeptide-tRNA to the P-site and allowing another cycle to begin. TUFM:GDP is regenerated to TUFM:GTP by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor TSFM (EF-Ts, EF-TsMt).<br>Translation is terminated when MTRF1L:GTP (MTRF1a:GTP) recognizes an UAA or UAG termination codon at the A-site of the ribosome (Tsuboi et al. 2009). GTP hydrolysis does not appear to be required. The tRNA-aminoacyl bond between the translated polypeptide and the final tRNA at the P-site is hydrolyzed by the 39S subunit, facilitating release of  the polypeptide. MRRF (RRF) and GFM2:GTP (EF-G2mt:GTP) then act to release the remaining tRNA and mRNA from the ribosome and dissociate the 55S ribosome into 28S and 39S subunits.<br>Mutations have been identified in genes encoding mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and translation factors. These have been shown to be pathogenic, causing neurological and other diseases (reviewed in Koopman et al. 2013, Pearce et al. 2013).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3312	PRC2 methylates histones and DNA		Polycomb group proteins are responsible for the heritable repression of genes during development (Lee et al. 2006, Ku et al. 2008, reviewed in Simon and Kingston 2009, Margueron and Reinberg 2011, Di Croce and Helin 2013). Two major families of Polycomb complexes exist: Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). PRC1 and PRC2 each appear to comprise sets of distinct complexes that contain common core subunits and distinct accessory subunits (reviewed in Nayak et al. 2011). PRC2, through its component EZH2 or, in some complexes, EZH1 produces the initial molecular mark of repression, the trimethylation of lysine-27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3). How PRC2 is initially recruited to a locus remains unknown, however cytosine-guanine (CpG) motifs and transcripts have been suggested. Different mechanisms may be used at different loci. The trimethylated H3K27 produced by PRC2 is bound by the Polycomb subunit of PRC1. PRC1 ubiquitinates histone H2A and maintains repression.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3313	Hedgehog 'on' state		Hedgehog is a secreted morphogen that has evolutionarily conserved roles in body organization by regulating the activity of the Ci/Gli transcription factor family. In Drosophila in the absence of Hh signaling, full-length Ci is partially degraded by the proteasome to generate a truncated repressor form that translocates to the nucleus to represses Hh-responsive genes. Binding of Hh ligand to the Patched (PTC) receptor allows the 7-pass transmembrane protein Smoothened (SMO) to be activated in an unknown manner, disrupting the partial proteolysis of Ci and allowing the full length activator form to accumulate (reviewed in Ingham et al, 2011; Briscoe and Therond, 2013).  <br>While many of the core components of Hh signaling are conserved from flies to humans, the pathways do show points of significant divergence. Notably, the human genome encodes three Ci homologues, GLI1, 2 and 3 that each play slightly different roles in regulating Hh responsive genes. GLI3 is the primary repressor of Hh signaling in vertebrates, and is converted to the truncated GLI3R repressor form in the absence of Hh. GLI2 is a potent activator of transcription in the presence of Hh but contributes only minimally to the repression function. While a minor fraction of GLI2 protein is processed into the repressor form in the absence of Hh, the majority is either fully degraded by the proteasome or sequestered in the full-length form in the cytosol by protein-protein interactions. GLI1 lacks the repression domain and appears to be an obligate transcriptional activator (reviewed in Briscoe and Therond, 2013).<br> Vertebrate but not fly Hh signaling also depends on the movement of pathway components through the primary cilium. The primary cilium is a non-motile microtubule based structure whose construction and maintenance depends on intraflagellar transport (IFT). Anterograde IFT moves molecules from the ciliary base along the axoneme to the ciliary tip in a manner that requires the microtubule-plus-end directed kinesin KIF3 motor complex and the IFT-B protein complex, while retrograde IFT back to the ciliary base depends on the minus-end directed dynein motor and the IFT-A complex. Genetic screens have identified a number of cilia-related proteins that are required both to maintain Hh in the 'off' state and to transduce the signal when the pathway is activated (reviewed in Hui and Angers, 2011; Goetz and Anderson, 2010).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3317	Caspase activation via dependence receptors in the absence of ligand		In the presence of Netrin1, DCC and UNC5 generate attractive and repulsive signals to growing axons. In the absence of Netrin-1, DCC induces cell death signaling initiated via caspase cleavage of DCC and the interaction of caspase-9. Recent reports have shown that UNC5 receptors similarly induce apoptosis in the absence of Netrin-1. These reactions proceed without a requirement for cytochrome c release from mitochondria or interaction with apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF1). DCC thus regulates an apoptosome-independent pathway for caspase activation. DCC and UNC-5 are hence defined as dependence receptors. Dependence receptors exhibit dual functions depending on the availability of ligand. They create cellular states of dependence on their respective ligands by either inducing apoptosis when unoccupied by the ligand, or inhibiting apoptosis in the presence of the ligand.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3318	MTOR signaling		Target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a highly-conserved serine/threonine kinase that regulates cell growth and division in response to energy levels, growth signals, and nutrients (Zoncu et al. 2011). Control of mTOR activity is critical for the cell since its dysregulation leads to cancer, metabolic disease, and diabetes (Laplante & Sabatini 2012). In cells, mTOR exists as two structurally distinct complexes termed mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), each one with specificity for different sets of effectors. mTORC1 couples energy and nutrient abundance to cell growth and proliferation by balancing anabolic (protein synthesis and nutrient storage) and catabolic (autophagy and utilization of energy stores) processes.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3322	RHO GTPases regulate CFTR trafficking		Activated RHO GTPase RHOQ (TC10) regulates the trafficking of CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) by binding to GOPC (Golgi-associated and PDZ and coiled-coil motif-containing protein) also known as PIST, FIG or CAL. GOPC is a Golgi resident protein that binds several membrane proteins, thereby modulating their expression. In the absence of RHOQ, GOPC bound to CFTR directs CFTR for lysosomal degradation, while GTP-bound RHOQ directs GOPC:CFTR complex to the plasma membrane, thereby rescuing CFTR (Neudauer et al. 2001, Cheng et al. 2005).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3327	SUMOylation of DNA damage response and repair proteins		Several factors that participate in DNA damage response and repair are SUMOylated (reviewed in Dou et al. 2011, Bekker-Jensen and Mailand 2011, Ulrich 2012, Psakhye and Jentsch 2012, Bologna and Ferrari 2013, Flotho and Melchior 2013, Jackson and Durocher 2013). SUMOylation can alter enzymatic activity and protein stability or it can serve to recruit additional factors. For example, SUMOylation of Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) causes TDG to lose affinity for its product, an abasic site opposite a G residue, and thus increases turnover of the enzyme. During repair of double-strand breaks SUMO1, SUMO2, SUMO3, and the SUMO E3 ligases PIAS1 and PIAS4 accumulate at double-strand breaks where BRCA1, HERC1, RNF168, MDC1, and TP53BP1 are SUMOylated. SUMOylation of BRCA1 may increase its ubiquitin ligase activity while SUMOylation of MDC1 and HERC2 appears to play a role in recruitment of proteins such as RNF4 and RNF8 to double strand breaks. Similarly SUMOylation of RPA1 (RPA70) recruits RAD51 in the homologous recombination pathway. View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=3108214 Reactome].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3330	RHO GTPases activate IQGAPs		IQGAPs constitute a family of scaffolding proteins characterized by a calponin homology (CH) domain, a polyproline binding region (WW domain), a tandem of four IQ (isoleucine and glutamine-rich) repeats and a RAS GTPase-activating protein-related domain (GRD). Three IQGAPs have been identified in human, IQGAP1, IQGAP2 and IQGAP3. The best characterized is IQGAP1 and over 90 proteins have been reported to bind to it. IQGAPs integrate multiple signaling pathways and coordinate a large variety of cellular activities (White et al. 2012). IQGAP proteins IQGAP1, IQGAP2 and IQGAP3, bind activated RHO GTPases RAC1 and CDC42 via their GRD and stabilize them in their GTP-bound state (Kuroda et al. 1996, Swart-Mataraza et al. 2002, Wang et al. 2007). IQGAPs bind F-actin filaments via the CH domain and modulate cell shape and motility through regulation of G-actin/F-actin equilibrium (Brill et al. 1996, Fukata et al. 1997, Bashour et al. 1997, Wang et al. 2007, Pelikan-Conchaudron et al. 2011). Binding of IQGAPs to F-actin is inhibited by calmodulin binding to the IQ repeats (Bashour et al. 1997, Pelikan-Conchaudron et al. 2011). Based on IQGAP1 studies, IQGAPs presumably function as homodimers (Bashour et al. 1997).<p>IQGAP1 is involved in the regulation of adherens junctions through its interaction with E-cadherin (CDH1) and catenins (CTTNB1 and CTTNA1) (Kuroda et al. 1998, Hage et al. 2009). IQGAP1 contributes to cell polarity and lamellipodia formation through its interaction with microtubules (Fukata et al. 2002, Suzuki and Takahashi 2008).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3331	Mitochondrial biogenesis		Mitochondrial biogenesis and remodeling occur in response to exercise and redox state (reviewed in Scarpulla et al. 2012, Handy and Loscalzo 2012, Piantadosi and Suliman 2012, Scarpulla 2011, Wenz et al. 2011, Bo et al. 2010, Jornayvaz and Shulman 2010, Ljubicic et al. 2010, Hock and Kralli 2009, Canto and Auwerx 2009, Lin 2009, Scarpulla 2008, Ventura-Clapier et al. 2008). It is hypothesized that calcium influx and energy depletion are the signals that initiate changes in gene expression leading to new mitochondrial proteins. Energy depletion causes a reduction in ATP and an increase in AMP which activates AMPK. AMPK in turn phosphorylates the coactivator PGC-1alpha (PPARGC1A), one of the master regulators of mitochondrial biosynthesis. Likewise, p38 MAPK is activated by muscle contraction (possibly via calcium and CaMKII) and phosphorylates PGC-1alpha. CaMKIV responds to intracellular calcium by phosphorylating CREB, which activates expression of PGC-1alpha.<br>Deacetylation of PGC-1alpha by SIRT1 may also play a role in activation (Canto et al. 2009, Gurd et al. 2011), however Sirt11 deacetylation of Ppargc1a in mouse impacted genes related to glucose metabolism rather than mitochondrial biogenesis (Rodgers et al. 2005) and mice lacking SIRT1 in muscle had normal levels of mitochondrial biogenesis in response to exercise (Philp et al. 2011) so the role of deacetylation is not fully defined. PGC-1beta and PPRC appear to act similarly to PGC-1alpha but they have not been as well studied.<br>Phosphorylated PGC-1alpha does not bind DNA directly but instead interacts with other transcription factors, notably NRF1 and NRF2 (via HCF1). NRF1 and NRF2 together with PGC-1alpha activate the transcription of nuclear-encoded, mitochondrially targeted proteins such as TFB2M, TFB1M, and TFAM.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3332	RAF-independent MAPK1/3 activation		Depending upon the stimulus and cell type mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway can transmit signals to regulate many different biological processes by virtue of their ability to target multiple effector proteins (Kyriakis JM & Avruch J 2012; Yoon and Seger 2006; Shaul YD & Seger R 2007; Arthur JS & Ley SC 2013). In particular, the extracellular signal-regulated kinases MAPK3(ERK1) and MAPK1 (ERK2) are involved in diverse cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, regulation of inflammatory responses, cytoskeletal remodeling, cell motility and invasion through the increase of matrix metalloproteinase production (Viala E & Pouyssegur J 2004; Hsu MC et al. 2006; Dawson CW et al.2008; Kuriakose T et al. 2014).The canonical RAF:MAP2K:MAPK1/3 cascade is stimulated by various extracellular stimuli including hormones, cytokines, growth factors, heat shock and UV irradiation triggering the GEF-mediated activation of RAS at the plasma membrane and leading to the activation of the RAF MAP3 kinases. However, many physiological and pathological stimuli have been found to activate MAPK1/3 independently of RAF and RAS (Dawson CW et al. 2008; Wang J et al. 2009; Kuriakose T et al. 2014). For example, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), but not RAF1, was reported to regulate MAP2K1/2 and MAPK1/3 (MEK and ERK) activation in rat hepatoma H4IIE and human erythroleukemia K562 cells in response to autophagy stimuli (Wang J et al. 2009). Tumor progression locus 2 (TPL2, also known as MAP3K8 and COT) is another MAP3 kinase which promotes MAPK1/3 (ERK)-regulated immune responses downstream of toll-like receptors (TLR), TNF receptor and IL1beta signaling pathways (Gantke T et al. 2011).<p>In response to stimuli the cell surface receptors transmit signals inducing MAP3 kinases, e.g., TPL2, MEKK1, which in turn phosphorylate MAP2Ks (MEK1/2). MAP2K then phosphorylate and activate the MAPK1/3 (ERK1 and ERK2 MAPKs). Activated MAPK1/3 phosphorylate and regulate the activities of an ever growing pool of substrates that are estimated to comprise over 160 proteins (Yoon and Seger 2006). The majority of ERK substrates are nuclear proteins, but others are found in the cytoplasm and other organelles. Activated MAPK1/3 can translocate to the nucleus, where they phosphorylate and regulate various transcription factors, such as Ets family transcription factors (e.g., ELK1), ultimately leading to changes in gene expression (Zuber J et al. 2000).

The target genes of each transcription factor overlap extensively: POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG co-occupy at least 353 genes (Boyer et al. 2005). About half of POU5F1 targets also bind SOX2 and about 90% of these also bind NANOG (Boyer et al. 2005). Upon binding the transcription factors activate expression of one subset of target genes and repress another subset (Kim et al. 2006, Matoba et al. 2006, Player et al. 2006, Babaie et al. 2007). The targets listed in this module are those that have been described as composing activated genes in the core transcriptional network of pluripotent stem cells (Assou et al. 2007, Chavez et al. 2009, Jung et al. 2010).

The effect of RHOG activity on cellular morphology, exhibited in the formation of microtubule-dependent cellular protrusions, depends both on RHOG interaction with KTN1, as well as on the kinesin activity (Vignal et al. 2001). RHOG and KTN1 also cooperate in microtubule-dependent lysosomal transport (Vignal et al. 2001).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3339	TCF dependent signaling in response to WNT		19 WNT ligands and 10 FZD receptors have been identified in human cells; interactions amongst these ligands and receptors vary in a developmental and tissue-specific manner and lead to activation of so-called 'canonical' and 'non-canonical' WNT signaling.  In the canonical WNT signaling pathway, binding of a WNT ligand to the Frizzled (FZD) and lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) receptors results in the inactivation of the destruction complex, the stabilization and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and subsequent activation of T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancing factor (TCF/LEF)-dependent transcription. Transcriptional activation in response to canonical WNT signaling controls processes such as cell fate, proliferation and self renewal of stem cells, as well as contributing to oncogenesis (reviewed in MacDonald et al, 2009; Saito-Diaz et al, 2013; Kim et al, 2013).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3345	Resolution of Abasic Sites (AP sites)		Resolution of AP sites can occur through the single nucleotide replacement pathway or through the multiple nucleotide patch replacement pathway, also known as the long-patch base excision repair (BER). Except for the APEX1-independent resolution of AP sites via single nucleotide base excision repair mediated by NEIL1 or NEIL2 (Wiederhold et al. 2004, Das et al. 2006), single nucleotide and multiple-nucleotide patch replacement pathways are both initiated by APEX1-mediated displacement of DNA glycosylases and cleavage of the damaged DNA strand by APEX1 immediately 5' to the AP site (Wilson et al. 1995, Bennett et al. 1997, Masuda et al. 1998). The BER proceeds via the single nucleotide replacement when the AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) deoxyribose residue at the 5' end of the APEX1-created single strand break (SSB) (5'dRP) can be removed by the 5'-exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase beta (POLB) (Bennett et al. 1997). POLB fills the created single nucleotide gap by adding a nucleotide complementary to the undamaged DNA strand to the 3' end of the SSB. The SSB is subsequently ligated by DNA ligase III (LIG3) which, in complex with XRCC1, is recruited to the BER site by an XRCC1-mediated interaction with POLB (Kubota et al. 1996). BER proceeds via the multiple-nucleotide patch replacement pathway when the AP residue at the 5' end of the APEX1-created SSB undergoes oxidation-related damage (5'ddRP) and cannot be cleaved by POLB (Klungland and Lindahl 1997). Long-patch BER can be completed by POLB-mediated DNA strand displacement synthesis in the presence of PARP1 or PARP2, FEN1 and DNA ligase I (LIG1) (Prasad et al. 2001). When the PCNA-containing replication complex is available, as is the case with cells in S-phase of the cell cycle, DNA strand displacement synthesis is catalyzed by DNA polymerase delta (POLD) or DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) complexes, in the presence of PCNA, RPA, RFC, APEX1, FEN1 and LIG1 (Klungland and Lindahl 1997, Dianova et al. 2001). It is likely that the 9-1-1 repair complex composed of HUS1, RAD1 and RAD9 interacts with and coordinates components of BER, but the exact mechanism and timing have not been elucidated (Wang et al. 2004, Smirnova et al. 2005, Guan et al. 2007, Balakrishnan et al. 2009).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3348	Macroautophagy		Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) acts as a buffer against starvation by liberating building materials and energy sources from cellular components. It has additional roles in embryonic development, removal of apoptotic cells or organelles, antigen presentation, protection against toxins and as a degradation route for aggregate-prone proteins and infectious agents. The dysregulation of autophagy is involved in several human diseases, for example, Crohn's disease, cancer and neurodegeneration (Ravikumar et al. 2010).<br>Autophagy is highly conserved from yeast to humans; much of the machinery was first identified in yeast (see Klionsky et al. 2011). Initially, double-membraned cup-shaped structures called the isolation membrane or phagophore engulf portions of cytoplasm. The membranes fuse to form the autophagosome. In yeast cells, autophagosomes are formed at the phagophore assembly site (PAS) next to the vacuole. In mammals, autophagosomes appear throughout the cytoplasm then move along microtubules towards the microtubule-organising centre. This transport requires microtubules and the function of dynein motor proteins; depolymerization of microtubules or inhibition of dynein-dependent transport results in inhibition of autophagy (Kochl et al. 2006, Kimura et al. 2008). Autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes forming autolysosomes whose contents are degraded by lysosomal hydrolases (Mizushima et al. 2011).<br><br>The origins of the autophagosomal membrane and the  incorporation of existing membrane material have been extensively debated. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs), the Golgi, the plasma membrane and recycling endosomes have all been implicated in the nucleation of the isolation membrane and subsequent growth of the membrane (Lamb et al. 2013). Recently 3D tomographic imaging of isolation membranes has shown the cup-shaped isolation membrane tightly sandwiched between two sheets of ER and physically connected to the ER through a narrow membrane tube (Hayashi-Nishino et al. 2009, Yla-Anttila et al. 2009). This suggests that isolation membrane formation and elongation are guided by adjacent ER sheets, supporting the now prevalent 'ER cradle' model, which suggests that the isolation membrane arises from the ER (Hayashi-Nishino et al. 2009, Shibutani & Yoshimori 2014).<br><br>Autophagy is tightly regulated. The induction of autophagy in response to starvation is partly mediated by inactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (Noda & Ohsumi 1998) and activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), while energy loss induces autophagy by activation of AMP kinase (AMPK). Other pathways regulating autophagy are regulated by calcium, cyclic AMP, calpains and the inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (Rubinsztein et al. 2012). <br><br>In mammals, two complexes cooperatively produce the isolation membrane. The ULK complex consists of ULK1/2, ATG13, (FIP200) and ATG101 (Alers et al. 2012). The PIK3C3-containing Beclin-1 complex consists of PIK3C3 (Vps34), BECN1 (Beclin-1, Atg6), PIK3R4 (p150, Vps15) and ATG14 (Barkor) (Matsunaga et al. 2009, Zhong et al. 2009). A similar complex where ATG14 is replaced by UVRAG functions later in autophagosome maturation and endocytic traffic (Itakura et al. 2008, Liang et al. 2008). Binding of KIAA0226 to this complex negatively regulates the maturation process (Matsunaga et al. 2009). The ULK and Beclin-1 complexes are recruited to specific autophagosome nucleation regions where they stimulate phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) production and facilitate the elongation and initial membrane curvature of the phagophore membrane (Carlsson & Simonsen 2015).<br><br>The ULK complex is considered the most upstream component of the mammalian autophagy pathway (Itakura & Mizushima 2010), acting as an integrator of the autophagy signals downstream of mTORC1. It is not fully understood how ULK1 is modulated in response to environmental cues. Phosphorylation plays an essential role (Dunlop & Tee 2013) but it is not clear how phosphorylation regulates ULK1 activities (Ravikumar et al. 2010). ULK1 kinase activity is required for autophagy, but the substrate(s) of ULK1 that mediate its autophagic function are not certain. ULK1 may also have kinase-independent functions in autophagy (Wong et al. 2013). <br><br> PIK3C3 (Vps34) is a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase that produces PI3P. It is essential for the early stages of autophagy and colocalizes strongly with early autophagosome markers (Axe et al. 2008). BECN1 binds several further proteins that affect autophagosome formation. Partners that induce autophagy include AMBRA1 (Fimia et al. 2007), UVRAG (Liang et al. 2006) and SH3GLB1 (Takahashi et al. 2007). Binding of BCL2 or BCL2L1 (Bcl-xL) inhibit autophagy (Pattingre et al. 2005, Ciechomska et al. 2009). The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor complex that binds BCL2 also interacts with BECN1, inhibiting autophagy (Vincencio et al. 2009). CISD2 (Nutrient-deprivation autophagy factor-1, NAF1), a component in the IP3R complex, interacts with BCL2 at the ER and stabilizes the BCL2-BECN1 interaction (Chang et al. 2010). Starvation leads to activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-1 (JNK1), which results in the phosphorylation of BCL2 and BCL2L1, which release their binding to BECN1 and thus induces autophagosome formation (Wei et al. 2008). <br><br>AMBRA1 can simultaneously bind dynein and the Beclin-1 complex.  During nutrient starvation, AMBRA1 is phosphorylated in a ULK1-dependent manner (Di Bartolomeo et al. 2010). This phosphorylation releases AMBRA1-associated Beclin-1 complexes from dynein and the microtubule network, freeing the complex to translocate to autophagy initiation sites (Di Bartolomeo et al. 2010). <br><br>A characteristic of this early phase of autophagosome formation is the formation of PI3P-enriched ER-associated structures called omegasomes (Axe et al. 2008) or cradles (Hayashi-Nishino et al. 2009). Omegasomes appear to concentrate at or near the connected mitochondria-associated ER membrane (Hamasaki et al. 2013). However, the phagophore also can incorporate existing material from other membrane sources such as ER exit sites (ERES), the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), the Golgi, the plasma membrane and recycling endosomes (Carlsson & Simonsen 2015). Omegasomes lead to the formation of the isolation membrane or phagophore, which is thought to form de novo by an unknown mechanism (Simonsen & Stenmark 2008, Roberts & Ktistakis 2013). Phagophore expansion is probably mediated by membrane uptake from endomembranes and semi-autonomous organelles (Lamb et al. 2013, Shibutani & Yoshimori 2014).<br><br>ATG9 is a direct target of ULK1. In nutrient-rich conditions mammalian ATG9 is localized to the trans-Golgi network and endosomes (including early, late and recycling endosomes), whereas under starvation conditions it is localized to autophagosomes, in a process that is dependent on ULK1 (Young et al. 2006). ATG9 is believed to play a role in the delivery of vesicles derived from existing membranes to the expanding phagophore (Lamb et al. 2013). Yeast Atg9 forms a complex with Atg2 and Atg18 (Reggiori et al. 2004). <br><br>PI3P produced at the initiation site is sensed by WIPI2b, the mammalian homologue of Atg18 (Polson et al. 2010). WIPI2b then recruits Atg16L1 (Dooley et al. 2014). There are four WIPI proteins in mammalian cells (Proikas-Cezanne et al. 2015). They are all likely bind PI3P and be recruited to membranes but the function of WIPI1, 3 and 4 in autophagy is not yet clear. WIPI4 (WDR45) has been shown to bind Atg2 and to be involved in lipid droplet formation (Velikkakath et al. 2012); mutations in WIPI4 have been shown to cause a neurodegenerative disease (Saitsu et al. 2013).<br><br>The elongation of the membrane that will become the autophagosome is regulated by two ubiquitination-like reactions. First, the ubiquitin-like molecule ATG12 is conjugated to ATG5 by ATG7, which acts as an E1-like activating enzyme, and ATG10, which has a role similar to an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The ATG5:ATG12 complex then interacts non-covalently with ATG16L1. This complex associates with the forming autophagosome but dissociates from completed autophagosomes (Geng & Klionski 2008). The second ubiquitin-like reaction involves the conjugation of ubiquitin-like molecules of the LC3 family (Weidberg et al. 2010). LC3 proteins are conjugated through their C-terminal glycine residues with PE by the E1-like ATG7 and E2-like ATG3. This allows LC3 proteins to associate with the autophagosome membrane. <br><br>The ATG12:ATG5:ATG16L1 complex (Mizushima et al., 2011) acts as an E3 like enzyme for the conjugation of LC3 family proteins (mammalian homologues of yeast Atg8) to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (Hanada et al. 2007, Fujita et al. 2008). LC3 PE can be deconjugated by the protease ATG4 (Li et al. 2011, 2012). ATG4 is also responsible for priming LC3 proteins by cleaving the C terminus to expose a glycine residue (Kirisako et al, 2000, Scherz Shouval et al. 2007). LC3 proteins remain associated with autophagosomes until they fuse with lysosomes. The LC3-like proteins inside the resulting autolysosomes are degraded, while those on the cytoplasmic surface are delipidated and recycled. ATG5:ATG12:ATG16L1-positive LC3-negative vesicles represent pre-autophagosomal structures (pre-phagophores and possibly early phagophores), ATG5:ATG12:ATG16L1-positive LC3-positive structures can be considered to be phagophores, and ATG5:ATG12:ATG16L1-negative LC3-positive vesicles can be regarded as mature autophagosomes (Tandia et al. 2011).<br><br>Phagophore expansion is probably mediated by membrane uptake from endomembranes as well as from semiautonomous organelles (Lamb et al. 2013, Shibutani & Yoshimori 2014).<br><br>The mechanisms involved in the closure of the phagophore membrane are poorly understood. As the phagophore is a double-membraned structure, its closure involves the fusion of a narrow opening, a process that is distinct from other membrane fusion events (Carlsson & Simonsen 2015). The topology of the phagophore is similar to that of cytokinesis, viral budding or multivesicular body (MVB) formation. These processes rely on the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) (Rusten et al. 2012). ESCRT and associated proteins facilitate membrane budding away from the cytosol and subsequent cleavage of the bud neck (Hurley & Hanson 2010). Several studies have shown that depletion of ESCRT subunits or the regulatory ATPase Vps4 causes an accumulation of autophagosomes (Filimonenko et al. 2007, Rusten et al. 2007) but it is not clear whether ESCRTs are required for autophagosome closure or for autophagosome to endosome fusion. UVRAG is also involved in the maturation step, recruiting proteins that bring about membrane fusion such as the class C Vps proteins, which activate Rab7 thereby promoting fusion with late endosomes and lysosomes (Liang et al. 2008).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3349	TP53 Regulates Metabolic Genes		While the p53 tumor suppressor protein (TP53) is known to inhibit cell growth by inducing apoptosis, senescence and cell cycle arrest, recent studies have found that p53 is also able to influence cell metabolism to prevent tumor development. TP53 regulates transcription of many genes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, nucleotides and amino acids, protein synthesis and aerobic respiration.<p>TP53 stimulates transcription of TIGAR, a D-fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase. TIGAR activity decreases glycolytic rate and lowers ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels in cells (Bensaad et al. 2006). TP53 may also negatively regulate the rate of glycolysis by inhibiting the expression of glucose transporters GLUT1, GLUT3 and GLUT4 (Kondoh et al. 2005, Schwartzenberg-Bar-Yoseph et al. 2004, Kawauchi et al. 2008).<p>TP53 negatively regulates several key points in PI3K/AKT signaling and downstream mTOR signaling, decreasing the rate of protein synthesis and, hence, cellular growth. TP53 directly stimulates transcription of the tumor suppressor PTEN, which acts to inhibit PI3K-mediated activation of AKT (Stambolic et al. 2001). TP53 stimulates transcription of sestrin genes, SESN1, SESN2, and SESN3 (Velasco-Miguel et al. 1999, Budanov et al. 2002, Brynczka et al. 2007). One of sestrin functions may be to reduce and reactivate overoxidized peroxiredoxin PRDX1, thereby reducing ROS levels (Budanov et al. 2004, Papadia et al. 2008, Essler et al. 2009). Another function of sestrins is to bind the activated AMPK complex and protect it from AKT-mediated inactivation. By enhancing AMPK activity, sestrins negatively regulate mTOR signaling (Budanov and Karin 2008, Cam et al. 2014). The expression of DDIT4 (REDD1), another negative regulator of mTOR signaling, is directly stimulated by TP63 and TP53. DDIT4 prevents AKT-mediated inactivation of TSC1:TSC2 complex, thus inhibiting mTOR cascade (Cam et al. 2014, Ellisen et al. 2002, DeYoung et al. 2008). TP53 may also be involved, directly or indirectly, in regulation of expression of other participants of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, such as PIK3CA (Singh et al. 2002), TSC2 and AMPKB (Feng et al. 2007). <p>TP53 regulates mitochondrial metabolism through several routes. TP53 stimulates transcription of SCO2 gene, which encodes a mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase assembly protein (Matoba et al. 2006). TP53 stimulates transcription of RRM2B gene, which encodes a subunit of the ribonucleotide reductase complex, responsible for the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides and essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA content in the cell (Tanaka et al. 2000, Bourdon et al. 2007, Kulawiec et al. 2009). TP53 also transactivates mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), a nuclear-encoded gene important for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transcription and maintenance (Park et al. 2009). Finally, TP53 stimulates transcription of the mitochondrial glutaminase GLS2, leading to increased mitochondrial respiration rate and reduced ROS levels (Hu et al. 2010). <p>The great majority of tumor cells generate energy through aerobic glycolysis, rather than the much more efficient aerobic mitochondrial respiration, and this metabolic change is known as the Warburg effect (Warburg 1956). Since the majority of tumor cells have impaired TP53 function, and TP53 regulates a number of genes involved in glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, it is likely that TP53 inactivation plays an important role in the metabolic derangement of cancer cells such as the Warburg effect and the concomitant increased tumorigenicity (reviewed by Feng and Levine 2010). On the other hand, some mutations of TP53 in Li-Fraumeni syndrome may result in the retention of its wild-type metabolic activities while losing cell cycle and apoptosis functions (Wang et al. 2013). Consistent with such human data, some mutations of p53, unlike p53 null state, retain the ability to regulate energy metabolism while being inactive in regulating its classic gene targets involved in cell cycle, apoptosis and senescence. Retention of metabolic and antioxidant functions of p53 protects p53 mutant mice from early onset tumorigenesis (Li et al. 2012).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3351	RHO GTPases activate PAKs		The PAKs (p21-activated kinases) are a family of serine/threonine kinases mainly implicated in cytoskeletal rearrangements. All PAKs share a conserved catalytic domain located at the carboxyl terminus and a highly conserved motif in the amino terminus known as p21-binding domain (PBD) or Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) domain. There are six mammalian PAKs that can be divided into two classes: class I (or conventional) PAKs (PAK1-3) and class II PAKs (PAK4-6). Conventional PAKs are important regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility and are additionally implicated in transcription through MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascades, death and survival signaling and cell cycle progression (Chan and Manser 2012).<p>PAK1, PAK2 and PAK3 are direct effectors of RAC1 and CDC42 GTPases. RAC1 and CDC42 bind to the CRIB domain. This binding induces a conformational change that disrupts inactive PAK homodimers and relieves autoinhibition of the catalytic carboxyl terminal domain (Manser et al. 1994, Manser et al. 1995, Zhang et al. 1998, Lei et al. 2000, Parrini et al. 2002; reviewed by Daniels and Bokoch 1999, Szczepanowska 2009). Autophosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue in the catalytic domain of PAKs (T423 in PAK1, T402 in PAK2 and T436 in PAK3) is necessary for the kinase activity of PAK1, PAK2 and PAK3. Autophosphorylation of PAK1 serine residue S144, PAK2 serine residue S141, and PAK3 serine residue S154 disrupts association of PAKs with RAC1 or CDC42 and enhances kinase activity (Lei et al. 2000, Chong et al. 2001, Parrini et al. 2002, Jung and Traugh 2005, Wang et al. 2011). LIMK1 is one of the downstream targets of PAK1 and is activated through PAK1-mediated phosphorylation of the threonine residue T508 within its activation loop (Edwards et al. 1999). Further targets are the myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC), myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), filamin, cortactin, p41Arc (a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex), caldesmon, paxillin and RhoGDI, to mention a few (Szczepanowska 2009).<p>Class II PAKs also have a CRIB domain, but lack a defined autoinhibitory domain and proline-rich regions. They do not require GTPases for their kinase activity, but their interaction with RAC or CDC42 affects their subcellular localization. Only conventional PAKs will be annotated here.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3354	C-type lectin receptors		Pathogen recognition is central to the induction of T cell differentiation. Groups of pathogens share similar structures known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are recognised by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed on dendritic cells (DCs) to induce cytokine expression. PRRs include archetypical Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and non-TLRs such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) and intracellular nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich-repeat-containing family (NLRs). PRR recognition of PAMPs can lead to the activation of intracellular signalling pathways that elicit innate responses against pathogens and direct the development of adaptive immunity.<br>CLRs comprises a large family of receptors which bind carbohydrates, through one or more carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs), or which possess structurally similar C-type lectin-like domains (CTLDs) which do not necessarily recognise carbohydrate ligands. Some CLRs can induce signalling pathways that directly activate nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), whereas other CLRs affect signalling by Toll-like receptors. These signalling pathways trigger cellular responses, including phagocytosis, DC maturation, chemotaxis, the respiratory burst, inflammasome activation, and cytokine production.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3357	RHO GTPases activate PKNs		Protein kinases N (PKN), also known as protein kinase C-related kinases (PKR) feature a C-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain and three RHO-binding motifs at the N-terminus. RHO GTPases RHOA, RHOB, RHOC and RAC1 bind PKN1, PKN2 and PKN3 (Maesaki et al. 1999, Zhong et al. 1999, Owen et al. 2003, Modha et al. 2008, Hutchinson et al. 2011, Hutchinson et al. 2013), bringing them in proximity to the PIP3-activated co-activator PDPK1 (PDK1) (Flynn et al. 2000, Torbett et al. 2003). PDPK1 phosphorylates PKNs on a highly conserved threonine residue in the kinase activation loop, which is a prerequisite for PKN activation. Phosphorylation of other residues might also be involved in activation (Flynn et al. 2000, Torbett et al. 2003, Dettori et al. 2009). PKNs are activated by fatty acids like arachidonic acid and phospholipids in vitro, but the in vivo significance of this activation remains unclear (Palmer et al. 1995, Yoshinaga et al. 1999).<p>PKNs play important roles in diverse functions, including regulation of cell cycle, receptor trafficking, vesicle transport and apoptosis. PKN is also involved in the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by the androgen receptor. More than 20 proteins and several peptides have been shown to be phosphorylated by PKN1 and PKN2, including CPI-17 (Hamaguchi et al. 2000), alpha-actinin (Mukai et al. 1997), adducin (Collazos et al. 2011), CDC25C (Misaki et al. 2001), vimentin (Matsuzawa et al. 1997), TRAF1 (Kato et al. 2008), CLIP170 (Collazos et al. 2011) and EGFR (Collazos et al. 2011).

However, the cleavage itself appears not to be sufficient for the formation of an active caspase-8. Only the coordinated dimerization and cleavage of the zymogen produce efficient activation in vitro and apoptosis in cellular systems [Boatright KM and Salvesen GS 2003; Keller N et al 2010; Oberst A et al 2010].<p>The caspase-8 zymogens are present in the cells as inactive monomers, which are recruited to the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) by homophilic interactions with the DED domain of FADD. The monomeric zymogens undergo dimerization and the subsequent conformational changes at the receptor complex, which results in the formation of catalytically active form of procaspase-8.[Boatright KM et al 2003; Donepudi M et al 2003; Keller N et al 2010; Oberst A et al 2010].

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3359	DNA methylation		Methylation of cytosine is catalyzed by a family of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs): DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B transfer methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to cytosine, producing 5-methylcytosine and homocysteine (reviewed in Klose and Bird 2006, Ooi et al. 2009, Jurkowska et al. 2011, Moore et al. 2013). (DNMT2 appears to methylate RNA rather than DNA.) DNMT1, the first enzyme discovered, preferentially methylates hemimethylated CG motifs that are produced by replication (template strand methylated, synthesized strand unmethylated). Thus it maintains existing methylation through cell division. DNMT3A and DNMT3B catalyze de novo methylation at unmethylated sites that include both CG dinucleotides and non-CG motifs.<br>DNA from adult humans contains about 0.76 to 1.00 mole percent 5-methylcytosine (Ehrlich et al. 1982, reviewed in Klose and Bird 2006, Ooi et al. 2009, Moore et al. 2013). Methylation of DNA occurs at cytosines that are mainly located in CG dinucleotides. CG dinucleotides are unevenly distributed in the genome. Promoter regions tend to have a high CG-content, forming so-called CG-islands (CGIs), while the CG-content in the remaining part of the genome is much lower. CGIs tend to be unmethylated, while the majority of CGs outside CGIs are methylated. Methylation in promoters and first exons tends to repress transcription while methylation in gene bodies (regions of genes downstream of the promoter and first exon) correlates with transcription (reviewed in Ehrlich and Lacey 2013, Kulis et al. 2013). Proteins such as MeCP2 and MBDs specifically bind 5-methylcytosine and may recruit other factors.<br>Mammalian development has two major episodes of genome-wide demethylation and remethylation (reviewed in Zhou 2012, Guibert and Weber 2013, Hackett and Surani 2013, Dean 2014). In mice about 1 day after fertilization the paternal genome is actively demethylated by TET proteins together with thymine DNA glycosylase and the maternal genome is demethylated by passive dilution during replication, however methylation at imprinted sites is maintained. The genome has its lowest methylation level about 3.5 days post-fertilization. Remethylation occurs by 6.5 days post-fertilization. The second demethylation-remethylation event occurs in primordial germ cells of the developing embryo about 12.5 days post-fertilization. DNMT3A and DNMT3B, together with the non-catalytic DNMT3L, play major roles in the remethylation events (reviewed in Chen and Chan 2014). How the methyltransferases are directed to particular regions of the genome remains an area of active research. The mechanisms at each locus may differ in detail but a connection between histone modifications and DNA methylation has been observed (reviewed in Rose and Klose 2014).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3360	Uptake and function of diphtheria toxin		Diphtheria is a serious, often fatal human disease associated with damage to many tissues. Bacteria in infected individuals, however, are typically confined to the lining of the throat or to a skin lesion; systemic effects are due to the secretion of an exotoxin encoded by a lysogenic bacteriophage. The toxin is encoded as a single polypeptide but is cleaved by host furin-like proteases to yield an aminoterminal fragment A and a carboxyterminal fragment B, linked by a disulfide bond. Toxin cleavage can occur when it first contacts the target cell surface, as annotated here, or as late as the point at which fragment A is released into the cytosol. Fragment B mediates toxin uptake into target cell endocytic vesicles, where acidification promotes a conformational change enabling fragment B to form a channel in the vesicle membrane through which fragment A is extruded into the target cell cytosol. Cleavage of the inter-fragment disulfide bond frees DT fragment A, which catalyzes ADP ribosylation of the translation elongation factor 2 (EEF2) in a target cell, thereby blocking protein synthesis. Neither fragment is toxic to human cells by itself (Collier 1975; Pappenheim 1977; Murphy 2011). View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=5336415 Reactome].		9606

More than 50 forms of sialic acid are found in nature, the most abundant being N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac, N-acetylneuraminate) (Li & Chen 2012, Wickramasinghe & Medrano 2011).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3364	SIRT1 negatively regulates rRNA expression		Expression of rRNA genes is coupled to the overall metabolism of the cell by the NAD-dependent histone deacetylase SIRT1, a component of the Energy-dependent Nucleolar Silencing Complex (eNoSC) (Murayama et al. 2008, reviewed in Salminen and Kaarniranta 2009, Grummt and Voit 2010). eNoSC comprises Nucleomethylin (NML), SIRT1, and the histone methylase SUV39H1 (Murayama et al. 2008). Deacetylation and methylation of histone H3 in the chromatin of a rRNA gene by eNoSC causes reduced expression of the gene.  When glucose is low, NAD is high (NADH is low), activity of SIRT1 is high, and activity of rRNA genes is reduced. It is hypothesized that eNoSC forms on a nucleosome containing dimethylated lysine-9 on histone H3 (H3K9me2) and then eNoSC deacetylates and dimethylates the adjacent nucleosome, thus catalyzing spreading of H3K9me2 throughout the gene.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3365	RHO GTPases activate ROCKs		RHO associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinases ROCK1 and ROCK2 consist of a serine/threonine kinase domain, a coiled-coil region, a RHO-binding domain and a plekstrin homology (PH) domain interspersed with a cysteine-rich region. The PH domain inhibits the kinase activity of ROCKs by an intramolecular fold. ROCKs are activated by binding of the GTP-bound RHO GTPases RHOA, RHOB and RHOC to the RHO binding domain of ROCKs (Ishizaki et al. 1996, Leung et al. 1996), which disrupts the autoinhibitory fold. Once activated, ROCK1 and ROCK2 phosphorylate target proteins, many of which are involved in the stabilization of actin filaments and generation of actin-myosin contractile force. ROCKs phosphorylate LIM kinases LIMK1 and LIMK2, enabling LIMKs to phosphorylate cofilin, an actin depolymerizing factor, and thereby regulate the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (Ohashi et al. 2000, Sumi et al. 2001). ROCKs phosphorylate MRLC (myosin regulatory light chain), which stimulates the activity of non-muscle myosin II (NMM2), an actin-based motor protein involved in cell migration, polarity formation and cytokinesis (Amano et al. 1996, Riento and Ridley 2003, Watanabe et al. 2007, Amano et al. 2010). ROCKs also phosphorylate the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT1) of MLC phosphatase, inhibiting the phosphatase activity and preventing dephosphorylation of MRLC. This pathway acts synergistically with phosphorylation of MRLC by ROCKs towards stimulation of non-muscle myosin II activity (Kimura et al. 1996, Amano et al. 2010).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3372	TET1,2,3 and TDG demethylate DNA		About 2-6% of all cytosine residues and 70-80% of cytosine residues in CG dinucleotides in mammalian cells are methylated at the 5 position of the pyrimidine ring. The cytosine residues are methylated by DNA methyltransferases after DNA replication and can be demethylated by passive dilution during subsequent replication or by active modification of the 5-methylcytosine base. Cytosine demethylation is developmentally regulated: one wave of demethylation occurs in primordial germ cells and one wave occurs by active demethylation in the male pronucleus after fertilization.<br>Some mechanisms of active demethylation remain controversial, however progressive oxidation of the methyl group of 5-methylcytosine followed by base excision by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) has been reproducibly demonstrated in vivo (reviewed in Wu and Zhang 2011, Franchini et al 2012, Cadet and Wagner 2013, Kohli and Zhang 2013, Ponnaluri et al. 2013, Rasmussen and Helin 2016). Ten-eleven translocation proteins TET1, TET2, and TET3 are dioxygenases that first oxidize 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) (Tahiliani et al. 2009, Ito et al. 2010), which is found in significant quantities and specific genomic locations in stem cells and neurons (Kinney and Pradhan 2013). TET proteins can further oxidize 5-hmC to 5-formylcytosine (5-fC) and then 5-carboxylcytosine (5-caC) (He et al. 2011, Ito et al. 2011). G:5-fC and G:5-caC base pairs are recognized by TDG, which excises the 5-fC or 5-caC and leaves an abasic site.<br>TET1 in mouse is expressed in neurons and its expression depends on neuronal activity (Guo et al. 2011, Kaas et al. 2013, Zhang et al. 2013). TET1 is also found in embryonic stem cells (Ficz et al. 2011, Koh et al. 2011, Wu et al. 2011) and in primordial germ cells of mice, where it plays a role in erasure of imprinting (Yamaguchi et al. 2013). TET3 is expressed in oocytes and zygotes of mice and is required for demethylation in the male pronucleus (Gu et al. 2011, Iqbal et al. 2011).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3374	Signaling by leptin		Leptin (LEP, OB, OBS), a circulating adipokine, and its receptor LEPR (DB, OBR) control food intake and energy balance and are implicated in obesity-related diseases (recently reviewed in Amitani et al. 2013, Dunmore and Brown 2013, Cottrell and Mercer 2012, La Cava 2012, Marroqui et al. 2012, Paz-Filho et al. 2012, Denver et al. 2011, Lee 2011, Marino et al. 2011, Morton and Schwartz 2011, Scherer and Buettner 2011, Shan and Yeo 2011, Wauman and Tavernier 2011, Dardeno et al. 2010, Bjorbaek 2009, Morris and Rui 2009, Myers et al. 2008), including cancer (Guo et al. 2012), inflammation (Newman and Gonzalez-Perez 2013, Iikuni et al. 2008), and angiogenesis (Gonzalez-Perez et al. 2013).<br>The identification of spontaneous mutations in the leptin gene (ob or LEP) and the leptin receptor gene (Ob-R, db or LEPR) genes in mice opened up a new field in obesity research. Leptin was discovered as the product of the gene affected by the ob (obesity) mutation, which causes obesity in mice. Likewise LEPR is the product of the gene affected by the db (diabetic) mutation. Leptin binding to LEPR induces canonical (JAK2/STATs; MAPK/ERK 1/2, PI-3K/AKT) and non-canonical signaling pathways (PKC, JNK, p38 MAPK and AMPK) in diverse cell types. The binding of leptin to the long isoform of LEPR (OB-Rl) initiates a phosphorylation cascade that results in transcriptional activation of target genes by STAT5 and STAT3 and activation of the PI3K pathway(not shown here), the MAPK/ERK pathway, and the mTOR/S6K pathway. Shorter LEPR isoforms with truncated intracellular domains are unable to activate the STAT pathway, but can transduce signals by way of activation of JAK2, IRS-1 or ERKs, including MAPKs.<br>LEPR is constitutively bound to the JAK2 kinase. Binding of LEP to LEPR causes a conformational change in LEPR that activates JAK2 autophosphorylation followed by phosphorylation of LEPR by JAK2. Phosphorylated LEPR binds STAT3, STAT5, and SHP2 which are then phosphorylated by JAK2. Phosphorylated JAK2 binds SH2B1 which then binds IRS1/2, resulting in phosphorylation of IRS1/2 by JAK2. Phosphorylated STAT3 and STAT5 dimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they activate transcription of target genes (Jovanovic et al. 2010). SHP2 activates the MAPK pathway. IRS1/2 activate the PI3K/AKT pathway which may be the activator of mTOR/S6K.<br>Several isoforms of LEPR have been identified (reviewed in Gorska et al. 2010). The long isoform (LEPRb, OBRb) is expressed in the hypothalamus and all types of immune cells. It is the only isoform known to fully activate signaling pathways in response to leptin. Shorter isoforms (LEPRa, LEPRc, LEPRd, and a soluble isoform LEPRe) are able to interact with JAK kinases and activate other pathways, however their roles in energy homeostasis are not fully characterized.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3376	RHO GTPases activate CIT		Citron kinase (CIT) or citron RHO-interacting kinase (CRIK) shares similarities with ROCK kinases. Like ROCK, it consists of a serine/threonine kinase domain, a coiled-coil region, a RHO-binding domain, a cysteine rich region and a plekstrin homology (PH) domain, but additionally features a proline-rich region and a PDZ-binding domain. A shorter splicing isoform of CIT, citron-N, is specifically expressed in the nervous system and lacks the kinase domain. Citron-N is a component of the post-synaptic density, where it binds to the PDZ domains of the scaffolding protein PDS-95/SAP90 (Zhang et al. 2006).<p>While the binding of CIT to RHO GTPases RHOA, RHOB, RHOC and RAC1 is well established (Madaule et al. 1995), the mechanism of CIT activation by GTP-bound RHO GTPases has not been elucidated. There are indications that CIT may be activated through autophosphorylation in the presence of active forms of RHO GTPases (Di Cunto et al. 1998). CIT appears to phosphorylate the myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC), the only substrate identified to date, on the same residues that are phosphorylated by ROCKs, but it has not been established yet how this relates to activation by RHO GTPases (Yamashiro et al. 2003). CIT and RHOA are implicated to act together in Golgi apparatus organization through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (Camera et al. 2003). CIT is also involved in the regulation of cytokinesis through its interaction with KIF14 (Gruneberg et al. 2006, Bassi et al. 2013, Watanabe et al. 2013) and p27(Kip1) (Serres et al. 2012).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3377	Melanin biosynthesis		Melanin biosynthesis takes place in specialized cells called melanocytes, within membrane-bound organelles referred to as melanosomes. Melanosomes are transferred via dendrites to surrounding keratinocytes. Keratinocytes and melanocytes are collectively known as 'the epidermal melanin unit'. Each melanocyte is in contact with approximately 40 keratinocytes in the basal and suprabasal layers (Cichorek et al. 2013). Melanocytes are distributed in the epidermis, hair follicles, the inner ear and the eye (Yamaguchi et al. 2007, Tolleson 2005). <br><br>Melanocytes in mammals and birds produce two chemically distinct types of melanin, black to brown eumelanin and yellow to reddish-brown pheomelanin (Ito & Wakamatsu 2008, Simon et al. 2009, d'Ischia et al. 2013). These differ in their responses to UV radiation; eumelanin has the ability to convert absorbed light energy into heat energy (Meredith & Riesz 2004) and to detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Bustamante et al. 1993), while pheomelanin is a phototoxic pro-oxidant (Samokhvalov 2005). Most natural melanin pigments contain eumelanin and pheomelanin (Ito & Wakamatsu 2003) and are termed 'mixed' melanins. Neuromelanins are mixed melanin-like pigments which are mainly found in neurons of the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus (Fedorow et al. 2005). Synthesis of NM may prevent the accumulation of toxic catechol derivatives (Zecca et al. 2003). NM can sequester a variety of potentially damaging molecules such as beta-carbolines, heavy metal ions and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) (D'Amato et al. 1986), a drug which causes Parkinson's Disease-like symptoms.  Models suggest that mixed melanogenesis occurs in three stages (Ito et al. 2000). The initial stage of melanin biosynthesis is the production of cysteinyldopas, which continues while sufficient cysteine is available. The second stage is the oxidation of cysteinyldopas to produce pheomelanin, which continues while cysteinyldopa concentration is sufficiently high. The last stage is the production of eumelanin, which begins when cysteinyldopas and cysteine are depleted. The ratio of eumelanin to pheomelanin is determined by tyrosinase activity and the availability of tyrosine and cysteine (Land et al. 2003).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3379	RHO GTPases activate formins		Formins are a family of proteins with 15 members in mammals, organized into 8 subfamilies. Formins are involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton. Many but not all formin family members are activated by RHO GTPases. Formins that serve as effectors of RHO GTPases belong to different formin subfamilies but they all share a structural similarity to Drosophila protein diaphanous and are hence named diaphanous-related formins (DRFs).<p>DRFs activated by RHO GTPases contain a GTPase binding domain (GBD) at their N-terminus, followed by formin homology domains 3, 1, and 2 (FH3, FH1, FH2) and a diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD) at the C-terminus. Most DRFs contain a dimerization domain (DD) and a coiled-coil region (CC) in between FH3 and FH1 domains (reviewed by Kuhn and Geyer 2014). RHO GTPase-activated DRFs are autoinhibited through the interaction between FH3 and DAD which is disrupted upon binding to an active RHO GTPase (Li and Higgs 2003, Lammers et al. 2005, Nezami et al. 2006). Since formins dimerize, it is not clear whether the FH3-DAD interaction is intra- or intermolecular. FH2 domain is responsible for binding to the F-actin and contributes to the formation of head-to-tail formin dimers (Xu et al. 2004). The proline-rich FH1 domain interacts with the actin-binding proteins profilins, thereby facilitating actin recruitment to formins and accelerating actin polymerization (Romero et al. 2004, Kovar et al. 2006).<p>Different formins are activated by different RHO GTPases in different cell contexts. FMNL1 (formin-like protein 1) is activated by binding to the RAC1:GTP and is involved in the formation of lamellipodia in macrophages (Yayoshi-Yamamoto et al. 2000) and is involved in the regulation of the Golgi complex structure (Colon-Franco et al. 2011). Activation of FMNL1 by CDC42:GTP contributes to the formation of the phagocytic cup (Seth et al. 2006). Activation of FMNL2 (formin-like protein 2) and FMNL3 (formin-like protein 3) by RHOC:GTP is involved in cancer cell motility and invasiveness (Kitzing et al. 2010, Vega et al. 2011). DIAPH1, activated by RHOA:GTP, promotes elongation of actin filaments and activation of SRF-mediated transcription which is inhibited by unpolymerized actin (Miralles et al. 2003). RHOF-mediated activation of DIAPH1 is implicated in formation of stress fibers (Fan et al. 2010). Activation of DIAPH1 and DIAPH3 by RHOB:GTP leads to actin coat formation around endosomes and regulates endosome motility and trafficking (Fernandez-Borja et al. 2005, Wallar et al. 2007). Endosome trafficking is also regulated by DIAPH2 transcription isoform 3 (DIAPH2-3) which, upon activation by RHOD:GTP, recruits SRC kinase to endosomes (Tominaga et al. 2000, Gasman et al. 2003). DIAPH2 transcription isoform 2 (DIAPH2-2) is involved in mitosis where, upon being activated by CDC42:GTP, it facilitates the capture of astral microtubules by kinetochores (Yasuda et al. 2004, Cheng et al. 2011). DIAPH2 is implicated in ovarian maintenance and premature ovarian failure (Bione et al. 1998). DAAM1, activated by RHOA:GTP, is involved in linking WNT signaling to cytoskeleton reorganization (Habas et al. 2001).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3380	TNF signaling		The inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is expressed in immune and nonimmune cell types including macrophages, T cells, mast cells, granulocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, fibroblasts, neurons, keratinocytes and smooth muscle cells as a response to tissue injury or upon immune responses to pathogenic stimuli (KÃ¶ck A. et al. 1990; Dubravec DB et al. 1990; Walsh LJ et al. 1991; te Velde AA et al. 1990; Imaizumi T et al. 2000). TNF-alpha interacts with two receptors, namely TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2). Activation of TNFR1 can trigger multiple signal transduction pathways inducing inflammation, proliferation, survival or cell death (Ward C et al. 1999; Micheau O and Tschopp J 2003; Widera D et al. 2006). Whether a TNF-alpha-stimulated cell will survive or die is dependent on autocrine/paracrine signals, and on the cellular context.<p>TNF binding to TNFR1 results initially in the formation of complex I that consists of TNFR1, TRADD (TNFR1-associated death domain), TRAF2 (TNF receptor associated factor-2), RIPK1 (receptor-interacting serin/threonine protein kinase 1), and E3 ubiquitin ligases BIRC2,BIRC3 (cIAP1/2,cellular inhibitor of apoptosis) and LUBAC (Micheau O and Tschopp J 2003). The conjugation of ubiquitin chains by BIRC2/3 and LUBAC (composed of HOIP, HOIL-1 and SHARPIN ) to RIPK1 allows further recruitment and activation of the TAK1 (also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7 (MAP3K7)) complex and IÎºB kinase (IKK) complex. TAK1 and IKK phosphorylate RIPK1 to limit its cytotoxic activity  and activate both nuclear factor kappaâ€�lightâ€�chainâ€�enhancer of activated B cells (NFkappaB) and mitogenâ€�activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathways promoting cell survival by induction of anti-apoptotic proteins such as BIRC, cellular FLICE (FADD-like IL-1Î²-converting enzyme)-like inhibitory protein (cFLIP) and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF and IL-6). When the survival pathway is inhibited, the TRADD:TRAF2:RIPK1 detaches from the membrane-bound TNFR1 signaling complex and recruits Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD) and procaspase-8 (also known as complex II). Once recruited to FADD, multiple procaspase-8 molecules interact via their tandem death-effector domains( DED), thereby facilitating both proximity-induced dimerization and proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-8, which are required for initiation of apoptotic cell death (Hughes MA et al. 2009; Oberst A et al. 2010). When caspase activity is inhibited under certain pathophysiological conditions (e.g. caspase-8 inhibitory proteins such as CrmA and vICA after infection with cowpox virus or CMV) or by pharmacological agents, deubiquitinated RIPK1 is physically and functionally engaged by its homolog RIPK3 leading to formation of the necrosome, a necroptosis-inducing complex consisting of RIPK1 and RIPK3 (Tewari M & Dixit VM 1995; Fliss PM & Brune W 2012; Sawai H 2013; Moquin DM et al. 2013; Kalai M et al. 2002; Cho YS et al. 2009, He S et al. 2009, Zhang DW et al., 2009). Within the complex II procaspase-8 can also form heterodimers with cFLIP isoforms, FLIP long (L) and FLIP short (S), which are encoded by the NFkappaB target gene CFLAR (Irmler M et al. 1997; Boatright KM et al. 2004; Yu JW et al. 2009; Pop C et al. 2011). FLIP(S) appears to act purely as an antagonist of caspase-8 activity blocking apoptotic but promoting necroptotic cell death (Feoktistova  et al. 2011). The regulatory function of FLIP(L) has been found to differ depending on its expression levels. FLIP(L) was shown to inhibit death receptor (DR)-mediated apoptosis only when expressed at high levels, while low cell levels of FLIP(L) enhanced DR signaling to apoptosis (Boatright KM et al. 2004; Okano H et al. 2003; Yerbes R et al. 2011; Yu JW et al. 2009; Hughes MA et al. 2016). In addition, caspase-8:FLIP(L) heterodimer activity within the TRADD:TRAF2:RIPK1:FADD:CASP8:FLIP(L) complex allowed cleavage of RIPK1 to cause the dissociation of the TRADD:TRAF2:RIP1:FADD:CASP8, thereby inhibiting RIPK1-mediated necroptosis (Feoktistova  et al. 2011, 2012). TNF-alpha can also activate sphingomyelinase (SMASE, such as SMPD2,3) proteins to catalyze hydrolysis of sphingomyeline into ceramide (Adam D et al.1996; Adam-Klages S et al. 1998; SÃ©gui B et al. 2001). Activation of neutral SMPD2,3 leads to an accumulation of ceramide at the cell surface and has proinflammatory effects. However, TNF can also activate the pro-apoptotic acidic SMASE via caspase-8 mediated activation of caspase-7 which in turn proteolytically cleaves and activates the 72kDa pro-A-SMase form (Edelmann B et al. 2011). Ceramide induces anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic responses. Further, ceramide can be converted by ceramidase into sphingosine, which in turn is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase into sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P exerts the opposite biological effects to ceramide by activating cytoprotective signaling to promote cell growth counteracting the apoptotic stimuli (Cuvillier O et al. 1996). Thus, TNF-alpha-induced TNFR1 activation leads to divergent intracellular signaling networks with extensive cross-talk between the pro-apoptotic/necroptotic pathway, and the other NFkappaB, and MAPK pathways providing highly specific cell responses initiated by various types of stimuli.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3381	Mismatch Repair		The mismatch repair (MMR) system corrects single base mismatches and small insertion and deletion loops (IDLs) of unpaired bases. MMR is primarily associated with DNA replication and is highly conserved across prokaryotes and eukaryotes. MMR consists of the following basic steps: a sensor (MutS homologue) detects a mismatch or IDL, the sensor activates a set of proteins (a MutL homologue and an exonuclease) that select the nascent DNA strand to be repaired, nick the strand, exonucleolytically remove  a region of nucleotides containing the mismatch, and finally a DNA polymerase resynthesizes the strand and a ligase seals the remaining nick (reviewed in Kolodner and Marsischkny 1999, Iyer et al. 2006, Li 2008, Fukui 2010, Jiricny 2013). <br>Humans have 2 different MutS complexes. The MSH2:MSH6 heterodimer (MutSalpha) recognizes single base mismatches and small loops of one or two unpaired bases. The MSH2:MSH3 heterodimer (MutSbeta) recognizes loops of two or more unpaired bases. Upon binding a mismatch, the MutS complex becomes activated in an ATP-dependent manner allowing for subsequent downstream interactions and movement on the DNA substrate. (There are two mechanisms proposed: a sliding clamp and a switch diffusion model.) Though the order of steps and structural details are not fully known, the activated MutS complex interacts with MLH1:PMS2 (MutLalpha) and PCNA, the sliding clamp present at replication foci. The role of PCNA is multifaceted as it may act as a processivity factor in recruiting MMR proteins to replicating DNA, interact with MLH1:PMS2 and Exonuclease 1 (EXO1) to initiate excision of the recently replicated strand and direct DNA polymerase delta to initiate replacement of bases. MLH1:PMS2 makes an incision in the strand to be repaired and EXO1 extends the incision to make a single-stranded gap of up to 1 kb that removes the mismatched base(s). (Based on assays of purified human proteins, there is also a variant of the mismatch repair pathway that does not require EXO1, however the mechanism is not clear. EXO1 is almost always required, it is possible that the exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase delta may compensate in some situations and it has been proposed that other endonucleases may perform redundant functions in the absence of EXO1.) RPA binds the single-stranded region and a new strand is synthesized across the gap by DNA polymerase delta. The remaining nick is sealed by DNA ligase I (LIG1).<br>Concentrations of MMR proteins MSH2:MSH6 and MLH1:PMS2 increase in human cells during S phase and are at their highest level and activity during this phase of the cell cycle (Edelbrock et al. 2009). Defects in MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2 cause hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, also known as Lynch syndrome) (reviewed in Martin-Lopez and Fishel 2013).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3382	POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2, NANOG repress genes related to differentiation		POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2, and NANOG bind elements in the promoters of target genes. The target genes of each transcription factor overlap extensively: POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG co-occupy at least 353 genes (Boyer et al. 2005). About half of POU5F1 targets also bind SOX2 and about 90% of these also bind NANOG (Boyer et al. 2005). Upon binding the transcription factors activate expression of one subset of target genes in the core transcriptional network of pluripotent stem cells and repress another subset (Kim et al. 2006, Matoba et al. 2006, Player et al. 2006, Assou et al. 2007, Babaie et al. 2007, Chavez et al. 2009, Jung et al. 2010).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3384	RHO GTPases activate rhotekin and rhophilins		Rhotekin (RTKN) is a protein with an N-terminally located RHO GTPase binding domain, that shares a limited sequence homology with PKNs and rhophilins. RTKN binds to GTP-bound RHOA, RHOB and RHOC and can inhibit their GTPase activity (Reid et al. 1996, Fu et al. 2000), which can be corroborated by protein kinase D-mediated phosphorylation of RTKN (Pusapati et al. 2012). RTKN is implicated in the establishment of cell polarity (Sudo et al. 2006), septin organization (Ito et al. 2005, Sudo et al. 2007) and stimulation of SRF-mediated transcription (Reynaud et al. 2000). RTKN can have an anti-apoptotic effect that depends on the activation of NFKB (NF-kappaB) (Liu et al. 2004). RTKN2 (rhotekin-2) is another rhotekin exclusively expressed in lymphocytes (Collier et al. 2004). The function and the mechanism of action of RTKN2 are unknown.<p>Rhophillins include two family members - rhophilin-1 (RHNP1) and rhophilin-2 (RHPN2) with ~75% sequence identity. A RHO GTPase binding domain is located at the N-terminus of rhophilins, followed by a BRO1 domain (characteristic of proteins involved in protein kinase C signaling) and a C-terminal PDZ domain. RHOA:GTP binds both RHPN1 and RHPN2 and these interactions may be involved in organization of the actin cytoskeleton and/or cell motility (Watanabe et al. 1996, Fujita et al. 2000, Peck et al. 2002). RHOB:GTP recruits RHPN2 to endosomes which may be involved in the function of thyroid cells (Mircescu et al. 2002).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3388	RHO GTPases activate WASPs and WAVEs		WASP and WAVE proteins belong to the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein family, with recessive mutations in the founding member WASP being responsible for the X-linked recessive immunodeficieny known as the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome. WASP proteins include WASP and WASL (N-WASP). WAVE proteins include WASF1 (WAVE1), WASF2 (WAVE2) and WASF3 (WAVE3). WASPs and WAVEs contain a VCA domain (consisting of WH2 and CA subdomains) at the C-terminus, responsible for binding to G-actin (WH2 subdomain) and the actin-associated ARP2/3 complex (CA subdomain). WASPs contain a WH1 (WASP homology 1) domain at the N-terminus, responsible for binding to WIPs (WASP-interacting proteins). A RHO GTPase binding domain (GBD) is located in the N-terminal half of WASPs and C-terminally located in WAVEs. RHO GTPases activate WASPs by disrupting the autoinhibitory interaction between the GBD and VCA domains, which allows WASPs to bind actin and the ARP2/3 complex and act as nucleation promoting factors in actin polymerization. WAVEs have the WAVE/SCAR homology domain (WHD/SHD) at the N-terminus, which binds ABI, NCKAP1, CYFIP2 and BRK1 to form the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC). Binding of the RAC1:GTP to the GBD of WAVEs most likely induces a conformational change in the WRC that allows activating phosphorylation of WAVEs by ABL1, thus enabling them to function as nucleation promoting factors in actin polymerization through binding G-actin and the ARP2/3 complex (Reviewed by Lane et al. 2014).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3390	Uptake and function of anthrax toxins		Bacillus anthracis bacteria target cells in an infected human through the action of three secreted bacterial proteins, lef (also known as LF, lethal factor), cya (also known as EF, edema factor), and pagA (also known as PA, protective antigen) (Turk 2007; Young and Collier 2007). lef is a protease that cleaves and inactivates many MAP2K (MAP kinase kinase, MEK) proteins (Duesbery et al. 1998; Vitale et al. 2000), disrupting MAP kinase signaling pathways. cya is an adenylate cyclase that mediates the constitutive production of cAMP (Leppla 1982), a molecule normally generated transiently in tightly regulated amounts in response to extracellular signals. Both lef and cya depend on pagA to enter their target cells, a strategy characteristic of bacterial binary toxins (Barth et al. 2004). pagA binds to the target cell receptors, is cleaved by furin or other cellular proteases, and thereupon forms an oligomer that exposes binding sites for lef and cya molecules (Young and Collier 2007). This complex is taken into the target cell by clathrin mediated endocytosis and delivered to endosomes. The low pH of the endosome causes the bacterial toxin complex to rearrange: the pagA oligomer forms a pore in the endosome membrane through which lef and cya molecules enter the target cell cytosol.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3391	Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP)		The culture medium of senescent cells in enriched in secreted proteins when compared with the culture medium of quiescent i.e. presenescent cells and these secreted proteins constitute the so-called senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), also known as the senescence messaging secretome (SMS). SASP components include inflammatory and immune-modulatory cytokines (e.g. IL6 and IL8), growth factors (e.g. IGFBPs), shed cell surface molecules (e.g. TNF receptors) and survival factors. While the SASP exhibits a wide ranging profile, it is not significantly affected by the type of senescence trigger (oncogenic signalling, oxidative stress or DNA damage) or the cell type (epithelial vs. mesenchymal) (Coppe et al. 2008). However, as both oxidative stress and oncogenic signaling induce DNA damage, the persistent DNA damage may be a deciding SASP initiator (Rodier et al. 2009). SASP components function in an autocrine manner, reinforcing the senescent phenotype (Kuilman et al. 2008, Acosta et al. 2008), and in the paracrine manner, where they may promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and malignancy in the nearby premalignant or malignant cells (Coppe et al. 2008). Interleukin-1-alpha (IL1A), a minor SASP component whose transcription is stimulated by the AP-1 (FOS:JUN) complex (Bailly et al. 1996), can cause paracrine senescence through IL1 and inflammasome signaling (Acosta et al. 2013).<p>Here, transcriptional regulatory processes that mediate the SASP are annotated. DNA damage triggers ATM-mediated activation of TP53, resulting in the increased level of CDKN1A (p21). CDKN1A-mediated inhibition of CDK2 prevents phosphorylation and inactivation of the Cdh1:APC/C complex, allowing it to ubiquitinate and target for degradation EHMT1 and EHMT2 histone methyltransferases. As EHMT1 and EHMT2 methylate and silence the promoters of IL6 and IL8 genes, degradation of these methyltransferases relieves the inhibition of IL6 and IL8 transcription (Takahashi et al. 2012). In addition, oncogenic RAS signaling activates the CEBPB (C/EBP-beta) transcription factor (Nakajima et al. 1993, Lee et al. 2010), which binds promoters of IL6 and IL8 genes and stimulates their transcription (Kuilman et al. 2008, Lee et al. 2010). CEBPB also stimulates the transcription of CDKN2B (p15-INK4B), reinforcing the cell cycle arrest (Kuilman et al. 2008). CEBPB transcription factor has three isoforms, due to three alternative translation start sites. The CEBPB-1 isoform (C/EBP-beta-1) seems to be exclusively involved in growth arrest and senescence, while the CEBPB-2 (C/EBP-beta-2) isoform may promote cellular proliferation (Atwood and Sealy 2010 and 2011). IL6 signaling stimulates the transcription of CEBPB (Niehof et al. 2001), creating a positive feedback loop (Kuilman et al. 2009, Lee et al. 2010). NF-kappa-B transcription factor is also activated in senescence (Chien et al. 2011) through IL1 signaling (Jimi et al. 1996, Hartupee et al. 2008, Orjalo et al. 2009). NF-kappa-B binds IL6 and IL8 promoters and cooperates with CEBPB transcription factor in the induction of IL6 and IL8 transcription (Matsusaka et al. 1993, Acosta et al. 2008). Besides IL6 and IL8, their receptors are also upregulated in senescence (Kuilman et al. 2008, Acosta et al. 2008) and IL6 and IL8 may be master regulators of the SASP.<p>IGFBP7 is also an SASP component that is upregulated in response to oncogenic RAS-RAF-MAPK signaling and oxidative stress, as its transcription is directly stimulated by the AP-1 (JUN:FOS) transcription factor. IGFBP7 negatively regulates RAS-RAF (BRAF)-MAPK signaling and is important for the establishment of senescence in melanocytes (Wajapeyee et al. 2008).<p>Please refer to Young and Narita 2009 for a recent review.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3392	LGI-ADAM interactions		Synapse formation and maturation require multiple interactions between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. These interactions are mediated by a diverse set of synaptogenic proteins (Kegel et al. 2013, Siddiqui & Craig 2011). Initial synapse formation needs both the binding of secreted proteins to presynaptic and postsynaptic receptors, and the direct binding between presynaptic and postsynaptic transmembrane proteins. One class of molecules that plays an important role in cellular interactions in nervous system development and function is the leucine-rich glioma inactivated (LGI) protein family. These are secreted synaptogenic proteins consisting of an LRR (leucine-rich repeat) domain and a epilepsy-associated or EPTP (epitempin) domain (Gu et al. 2002). Both protein domains are generally involved in protein-protein interactions. Genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that the mechanism of action of LGI proteins involves binding to a subset of cell surface receptors belonging to the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family, i.e. ADAM11, ADAM22 and ADAM23. These interactions play crucial role in the development and function of the vertebrate nervous system mainly mediating synaptic transmission and myelination (Kegel et al. 2013, Novak 2004, Seals & Courtneidge 2003).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3395	Cellular response to heat stress		"In response to exposure to elevated temperature and certain other proteotoxic stimuli (e.g., hypoxia, free radicals) cells activate a number of cytoprotective mechanisms known collectively as ""heat shock response"".  Major aspects of the heat shock response (HSR) are evolutionarily conserved events that allow cells to recover from protein damage induced by stress (Liu XD et al. 1997; Voellmy R & Boellmann F 2007;  Shamovsky I & Nudler E 2008; Anckar J & Sistonen L 2011). The main hallmark of HSR is the dramatic alteration of the gene expression pattern. A diverse group of protein genes is induced by the exposure to temperatures 3-5 degrees higher than physiological. Functionally, most of these genes are molecular chaperones that ensure proper protein folding and quality control to maintain cell proteostasis.<p>At the same time, heat shock-induced phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2alpha leads to the shutdown of the nascent polypeptide synthesis reducing the burden on the chaperone system that has to deal with the increased amount of misfolded and thermally denatured proteins (Duncan RF & Hershey JWB 1989; Sarkar A et al. 2002;  Spriggs KA et al. 2010).<p>The induction of HS gene expression primarily occurs at the level of transcription and is mediated by heat shock transcription factor HSF1(Sarge KD et al. 1993; Baler R et al. 1993). Human cells express five members of HSF protein family: HSF1, HSF2, HSF4, HSFX and HSFY. HSF1 is the master regulator of the heat inducible gene expression (Zuo J et al. 1995; Akerfelt M et al. 2010). HSF2 is activated in response to certain developmental stimuli in addition to being co-activated with HSF1 to provide promoter-specific fine-tuning of the HS response by forming heterotrimers with HSF1 (Ostling P et al. 2007; Sandqvist A et al. 2009). HSF4 lacks the transcription activation domain and acts as a repressor of certain genes during HS (Nakai A et al. 1997; Tanabe M et al. 1999; Kim SA et al. 2012). Two additional family members HSFX and HSFY, which are  located on the X and Y chromosomes respectively, remain to be characterized (Bhowmick BK et al. 2006; Shinka T et al. 2004; Kichine E et al. 2012).<p>Under normal conditions HSF1 is present in both cytoplasm and nucleus in the form of an inactive monomer. The monomeric state of HSF1 is maintained by an intricate network of protein-protein interactions that include the association with HSP90 multichaperone complex, HSP70/HSP40 chaperone machinery, as well as intramolecular interaction of two conserved hydrophobic repeat regions. Monomeric HSF1 is constitutively phosphorylated on Ser303 and Ser 307 by (Zou J et al. 1998; Knauf U et al. 1996; Kline MP & Moromoto RI 1997; Guettouche T et al. 2005). This phosphorylation plays an essential role in ensuring cytoplasmic localization of at least a subpopulation of HSF1 molecules under normal conditions (Wang X et al. 2004).<p>Exposure to heat and other proteotoxic stimuli results in the release of HSF1 from the inhibitory complex with chaperones and its subsequent trimerization, which is promoted by its interaction with translation elongation factor eEF1A1 (Baler R et al. 1993; Shamovsky I et al. 2006; Herbomel G et al 2013). The trimerization is believed to involve intermolecular interaction between hydrophobic repeats 1-3 leading to the formation of a triple coil structure. Additional stabilization of the HSF1 trimer is provided by the formation of intermolecular S-S bonds between Cys residues in the DNA binding domain (Lu M et al.2008). Trimeric HSF1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus where it binds the specific sequence in the promoter of hsp genes (Sarge KD et al. 1993; Wang Y and Morgan WD 1994). The binding sequence for HSF1 (HSE, heat shock element) contains series of inverted repeats nGAAn in head-to-tail orientation, with at least three elements being required for the high affinity binding. Binding of the HSF1 trimer to the promoter is not sufficient to induce transcription of the gene (Cotto J et al. 1996). In order to do so, HSF1 needs to undergo inducible phosphorylation on specific Ser residues such as Ser230, Ser326. This phosphorylated form of HSF1 trimer is capable of increasing the promoter initiation rate. HSF1 bound to DNA promotes recruiting components of the transcription mediator complex and  relieving promoter-proximal pause of RNA polymerase II through its interaction with TFIIH transcription factor (Yuan CX & Gurley WB 2000).<p>HSF1 activation is regulated in a precise and tight manner at multiple levels (Zuo J et al. 1995; Cotto J et al. 1996). This allows fast and robust activation of HS response to minimize proteotoxic effects of the stress. The exact set of HSF1 inducible genes is probably cell type specific. Moreover, cells in different pathophysiological states will display different but overlapping profile of HS inducible genes.

RAC1:GTP binds NOX2 complex in response to VEGF signaling by directly interracting with CYBB and NCF2, leading to enhancement of VEGF-signaling through VEGF receptor VEGFR2, which plays a role in angiogenesis (Ushio-Fukai et al. 2002, Bedard and Krause 2007). RAC2:GTP can also activate the NOX2 complex by binding to CYBB and NCF2, leading to production of superoxide in phagosomes of neutrophils which is necessary fo the microbicidal activity of neutrophils (Knaus et al. 1991, Roberts et al. 1999, Kim and Dinauer 2001, Jyoti et al. 2014).<p>NOX1 complex (composed of NOX1, NOXA1, NOXO1 and CYBA) and NOX3 complex (composed of NOX3, CYBA, NCF1 amd NCF2 or NOXA1) can also be activated by binding to RAC1:GTP to produce superoxide (Cheng et al. 2006, Miyano et al. 2006, Ueyama et al. 2006).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3397	Activated PKN1 stimulates transcription of AR (androgen receptor) regulated genes KLK2 and KLK3		PKN1, activated by phosphorylation at threonine T774, binds activated AR (androgen receptor) and promotes transcription from AR-regulated promoters. On one hand, phosphorylated PKN1 promotes the formation of a functional complex of AR with the transcriptional coactivator NCOA2 (TIF2) (Metzger et al. 2003). On the other hand, binding of phosphorylated PKN1, in complex with the activated AR, to androgen-reponsive promoters of KLK2 and KLK3 (PSA) genes, leads to PKN1-mediated histone phosphorylation. PKN1-phosphorylated histones recruit histone demethylases KDM4C (JMJD2C) and KDM1A (LSD1), and the ensuing demethylation of histones associated with the promoter regions of KLK2 and KLK3 genes increases their transcription (Metzger et al. 2005, Metzger et al. 2008).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3398	TNFR2 non-canonical NF-kB pathway		Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFA) exerts a wide range of biological effects through TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2). Under normal physiological conditions TNFR2 exhibits more restricted expression, being found on certain subpopulation of immune cells and few other cell types (Grell et al. 1995 ). TNFR1 mediated signalling pathways have been very well characterized but, TNFR2 has been much less well studied. TNFR1 upon activation by TNFA activates apoptosis through two pathways, involving the adaptor proteins TNFR1-associated death domain (TRADD) and fas-associated death domain (FADD). In contrast, TNFR2 signalling especially in highly activated T cells, induces cell survival pathways that can result in cell proliferation by activating transcription factor NF-kB (nuclear factor-kB) via the alternative non-canonical route. TNFR2 signalling seems to play an important role, in particular for the function of regulatory T cells. It offers protective roles in several disorders, including autoimmune diseases, heart diseases, demyelinating and neurodegenerative disorders and infectious diseases (Faustman & Davis 2010).<br>Activation of the non-canonical pathway by TNFR2 is mediated through a signalling complex that includes TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF2 and TRAF3), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP1 and cIAP2), and NF-kB-inducing kinase (NIK). In this complex TRAF3 functions as a bridging factor between the cIAP1/2:TRAF2 complex and NIK. In resting cells cIAP1/2 in the signalling complex mediates K48-linked polyubiquitination of NIK and subsequent proteasomal degradation making NIK levels invisible. Upon TNFR2 stimulation, TRAF2 is recruited to the intracellular TRAF binding motif and this also indirectly recruits TRAF1 and cIAP1/2, as well as TRAF3 and NIK which are already bound to TRAF2 in unstimulated cells. TRAF2 mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of cIAP1/2 and this in turn mediates cIAP dependent K48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3 leading to the proteasome-dependent degradation of the latter. As TRAF3 is degraded, NIK can no longer interact with TRAF1/2:cIAP complex. As a result NIK concentration in the cytosol increases and NIK gets stabilised and activated. Activated NIK phosphorylates IKKalpha, which in turn phosphorylates p100 (NFkB2) subunit. Phosphorylated p100 is also ubiquitinated by the SCF-beta-TRCP ubiquitin ligase complex and is subsequently processed by the proteaseome to p52, which is a transcriptionally competent NF-kB subunit in conjunction with RelB (Petrus et al. 2011, Sun 2011, Vallabhapurapu & Karin 2009).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3400	TRAIL  signaling		Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand or Apo 2 ligand (TRAIL/Apo2L) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family. This group of apoptosis induction pathways all work through protein interactions mediated by the intracellular death domain (DD), encoded within the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. TRAIL selectively induces apoptosis through its interaction with the Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) and caspase-8/10 (Wang S & el-Deiry WS 2003; Sprick MR et al. 2002). TRAIL and its receptors, TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2, were shown to be rapidly endocytosed via clathrin-dependent and -independent manner in human Burkitt's lymphoma B cells (BJAB) (Kohlhaas SL et al. 2007). However, FADD and caspase-8 were able to bind TRAIL-R1/R2 in TRAIL-stimulated BJAB cells at 4<sup>o</sup>C (at which membrane trafficking is inhibited), suggesting that the endocytosis was not required for an assembly of the functional TRAIL DISC complex. Moreover, blocking of clathrin-dependent endocytosis did not interfere with the capacity of TRAIL to promote apoptosis (Kohlhaas SL et al. 2007).<br> View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=75158 Reactome].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3401	Hedgehog ligand biogenesis		Mammalian genomes encode three Hedgehog ligands, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), Indian Hedgehog (IHH) and Desert Hedgehog (DHH).  These secreted morphogens can remain associated with lipid rafts on the surface of the secreting cell and affect developmental processes in adjacent cells. Alternatively, they can be released by proteolysis or packaging into vesicles or lipoprotein particles and dispersed to act on distant cells. SHH activity is required for organization of the limb bud, notochord and neural plate, IHH regulates bone and cartilage development and is partially redundant with SHH, and DHH contributes to germ cell development in the testis and formation of the peripheral nerve sheath (reviewed in Pan et al, 2013).  <br><br>Despite divergent biological roles, all Hh ligands are subject to proteolytic processing and lipid modification during transit to the surface of the secreting cell (reviewed in Gallet, 2011).  Precursor Hh undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage mediated by the C-terminal region to yield an amino-terminal peptide Hh-Np (also referred to as Hh-N) (Chen et al, 2011).  No other well defined role for the C-terminal region of Hh has been identified, and the secreted Hh-Np is responsible for all Hh signaling activity.  Hh-Np is modified with cholesterol and palmitic acid during transit through the secretory system, and both modifications contribute to the activity of the ligand (Porter et al, 1996; Pepinsky et al, 1998; Chamoun et al, 2001).  <br><br>At the cell surface, Hh-Np remains associated with the secreting cell membrane by virtue of its lipid modifications, which promote clustering of Hh-Np into lipid rafts (Callejo et al, 2006; Peters et al, 2004).  Long range dispersal of Hh-Np depends on the untethering of the ligand from the membrane through a variety of mechanisms.  These include release of monomers through the combined activity of the transmembrane protein Dispatched (DISP2) and the secreted protein SCUBE2, assembly into soluble multimers or apolipoprotein particles or release on the surface of exovesicles (Vyas et al, 2008; Tukachinsky et al, 2012; Chen 2004; Zeng et al, 2001; reviewed in Briscoe and Therond, 2013).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3404	Oxidative Stress Induced Senescence		Oxidative stress, caused by increased concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cell, can happen as a consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction induced by the oncogenic RAS (Moiseeva et al. 2009) or independent of oncogenic signaling. Prolonged exposure to interferon-beta (IFNB, IFN-beta) also results in ROS increase (Moiseeva et al. 2006). ROS oxidize thioredoxin (TXN), which causes TXN to dissociate from the N-terminus of MAP3K5 (ASK1), enabling MAP3K5 to become catalytically active (Saitoh et al. 1998). ROS also stimulate expression of Ste20 family kinases MINK1 (MINK) and TNIK through an unknown mechanism, and MINK1 and TNIK positively regulate MAP3K5 activation (Nicke et al. 2005).<p> <br>MAP3K5 phosphorylates and activates MAP2K3 (MKK3) and MAP2K6 (MKK6) (Ichijo et al. 1997, Takekawa et al. 2005), which act as p38 MAPK kinases, as well as MAP2K4 (SEK1) (Ichijo et al. 1997, Matsuura et al. 2002), which, together with MAP2K7 (MKK7), acts as a JNK kinase.<p> <br>MKK3 and MKK6 phosphorylate and activate p38 MAPK alpha (MAPK14) and beta (MAPK11) (Raingeaud et al. 1996), enabling p38 MAPKs to phosphorylate and activate MAPKAPK2 (MK2) and MAPKAPK3 (MK3) (Ben-Levy et al. 1995, Clifton et al. 1996, McLaughlin et al. 1996, Sithanandam et al. 1996, Meng et al. 2002, Lukas et al. 2004, White et al. 2007), as well as MAPKAPK5 (PRAK) (New et al. 1998 and 2003, Sun et al. 2007).<p> <br>Phosphorylation of JNKs (MAPK8, MAPK9 and MAPK10) by MAP3K5-activated MAP2K4 (Deacon and Blank 1997, Fleming et al. 2000) allows JNKs to migrate to the nucleus (Mizukami et al. 1997) where they phosphorylate JUN. Phosphorylated JUN binds FOS phosphorylated by ERK1 or ERK2, downstream of activated RAS (Okazaki and Sagata 1995, Murphy et al. 2002), forming the activated protein 1 (AP-1) complex (FOS:JUN heterodimer) (Glover and Harrison 1995, Ainbinder et al. 1997). <p> <br>Activation of p38 MAPKs and JNKs downstream of MAP3K5 (ASK1) ultimately converges on transcriptional regulation of CDKN2A locus. In dividing cells, nucleosomes bound to the CDKN2A locus are trimethylated on lysine residue 28 of histone H3 (HIST1H3A) by the Polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2), creating the H3K27Me3 (Me3K-28-HIST1H3A) mark (Bracken et al. 2007, Kotake et al. 2007). The expression of Polycomb constituents of PRC2 (Kuzmichev et al. 2002) - EZH2, EED and SUZ12 - and thereby formation of the PRC2, is positively regulated in growing cells by E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3 (Weinmann et al. 2001, Bracken et al. 2003). H3K27Me3 mark serves as a docking site for the Polycomb repressor complex 1 (PRC1) that contains BMI1 (PCGF4) and is therefore named PRC1.4, leading to the repression of transcription of p16INK4A and p14ARF from the CDKN2A locus, where PCR1.4 mediated repression of p14ARF transcription in humans may be context dependent (Voncken et al. 2005, Dietrich et al. 2007, Agherbi et al. 2009, Gao et al. 2012). MAPKAPK2 and MAPKAPK3, activated downstream of the MAP3K5-p38 MAPK cascade, phosphorylate BMI1 of the PRC1.4 complex, leading to dissociation of PRC1.4 complex from the CDKN2A locus and upregulation of p14ARF transcription (Voncken et al. 2005). AP-1 transcription factor, formed as a result of MAP3K5-JNK signaling, as well as RAS signaling, binds the promoter of KDM6B (JMJD3) gene and stimulates KDM6B expression. KDM6B is a histone demethylase that removes H3K27Me3 mark i.e. demethylates lysine K28 of HIST1H3A, thereby preventing PRC1.4 binding to the CDKN2A locus and allowing transcription of p16INK4A (Agger et al. 2009, Barradas et al. 2009, Lin et al. 2012).<p> <br>p16INK4A inhibits phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of RB family members by CDK4 and CDK6, leading to cell cycle arrest (Serrano et al. 1993). p14ARF inhibits MDM2-mediated degradation of TP53 (p53) (Zhang et al. 1998), which also contributes to cell cycle arrest in cells undergoing oxidative stress. In addition, phosphorylation of TP53 by MAPKAPK5 (PRAK) activated downstream of MAP3K5-p38 MAPK signaling, activates TP53 and contributes to cellular senescence (Sun et al. 2007).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3486	Abnormal conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to 2-hydroxyglutarate		Somatic mutations affecting arginine residue 132 of IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1, a cytosolic enzyme that normally catalyzes the NADP+-dependent conversion of isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate), are very commonly found in human glioblastomas (Parsons et al. 2008). These mutant proteins efficiently catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of 2-oxoglutarate to form 2-hydroxyglutarate. Cells expressing the mutant protein accumulate elevated levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate, probably in the cytosol as IDH1 is a cytosolic enzyme. The fate of the 2-hydroxyglutarate is unclear, but the high frequency with which the mutation is found in surveys of primary tumors is consistent with the possibility that it is advantageous to the tumor cells (Dang et al 2009).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3498	Assembly of the primary cilium		The primary cilium is one of two main types of cilia present on the surface of many eukaryotic cells (reviewed in Flieghauf et al, 2007). Unlike the motile cilia, which are generally present in large numbers on epithelial cells and are responsible for sensory function as well as wave-like beating motions, the primary cilium is a non-motile sensory organelle with roles in signaling and development and is present in a single copy at the apical surface of most quiescent cells (reviewed in Hsiao et al, 2012). Cilium biogenesis involves the anchoring of the basal body, a centriole-derived organelle, near the plasma membrane and the subsequent polymerization of the microtubule-based axoneme and extension of the plasma membrane (reviewed in Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011; Reiter et al, 2012). Although the ciliary membrane is continuous with the plasma membrane, the protein and lipid content of the cilium and the ciliary membrane are distinct from those of the bulk cytoplasm and plasma membrane (reviewed in Emmer et al, 2010; Rohatgi and Snell, 2010). This specialized compartment is established and maintained during cilium biogenesis by the formation of a ciliary transition zone, a proteinaceous structure that, with the transition fibres, anchors the basal body to the plasma membrane and acts as a ciliary pore to limit free diffusion from the cytosol to the cilium (reviewed in Nachury et al, 2010; Reiter et al, 2012). Ciliary components are targeted from the secretory system to the ciliary base and subsequently transported to the ciliary tip, where extension of the axoneme occurs, by a motor-driven process called intraflagellar transport (IFT). Anterograde transport of cargo from the ciliary base to the tip of the cilium requires kinesin-2 type motors, while the dynein-2 motor is required for retrograde transport back to the ciliary base.  In addition, both anterograde and retrograde transport depend on the IFT complex, a multiprotein assembly consisting of two subcomplexes, IFT A and IFT B. The primary cilium is a dynamic structure that undergoes continuous steady-state turnover of tubulin at the tip; as a consequence, the IFT machinery is required for cilium maintenance as well as biogenesis (reviewed in Bhogaraju et al, 2013; Hsiao et al, 2012; Li et al, 2012; Taschner et al, 2012; Sung and Leroux, 2013). The importance of the primary cilium in signaling and cell biology is highlighted by the wide range of defects and disorders, collectively known as ciliopathies, that arise as the result of mutations in genes encoding components of the ciliary machinery (reviewed in Goetz and Anderson, 2010; Madhivanan and Aguilar, 2014).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3513	Regulation of beta-cell development		The normal development of the pancreas during gestation has been intensively investigated over the past decade especially in the mouse (Servitja and Ferrer 2004; Chakrabarti and Mirmira 2003). Studies of genetic defects associated with maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) has provided direct insight into these processes as they take place in humans (Fajans et al. 2001). During embryogenesis, committed epithelial cells from the early pancreatic buds differentiate into mature endocrine and exocrine cells. It is helpful to schematize this process into four consecutive cellular stages, to begin to describe the complex interplay of signal transduction pathways and transcriptional networks. The annotations here are by no means complete - factors in addition to the ones described here must be active, and even for the ones that are described, only key examples of their regulatory effects and interactions have been annotated.<p>It is also important to realize that in the human, unlike the mouse, cells of the different stages can be present simultaneously in the developing pancreas and the linear representation of these developmental events shown here is an over-simplification of the actual developmental process (e.g., Sarkar et al. 2008).<p>The first stage of this process involves the predifferentiated epithelial cells of the two pancreatic anlagen that arise from the definitive endoderm at approximately somite stages 11-15 and undergo budding from somite stages 20-22. This period corresponds to gestational days 8.75-9.5 in the mouse, and 26 in the human.<p>Pancreatic buds subsequently coalesce to form a single primitive gland, while concomitantly a ductal tree lined by highly proliferative epithelial cells is formed. A subset of such epithelial cells is thought to differentiate into either endocrine or acinar exocrine cells. A third cellular stage is defined by the endocrine-committed progenitors that selectively express the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor NEUROG3. NEUROG3 is known to activate a complex transcriptional network that is essential for the specification of endocrine cells. Many transcription factors that are activated by NEUROG3 are also involved in islet-subtype cellular specification and in subsequent stages of differentiation of endocrine cells. This transient cellular stage thus leads to the generation of all known pancreatic endocrine cells, including insulin-producing beta-cells, and glucagon-producing alpha cells, the final stage of this schematic developmental process.<p>The diagram below summarizes interactions that take place between transcription factors and transcription factor target genes during these cellular stages, and shows cases where there is both functional evidence that a transcription factor is required for the target gene to be expressed, and biochemical evidence that this interaction is direct. We also describe instances where a signaling pathway is known to regulate a transcription factor gene in this process, even if the intervening signaling pathway is not fully understood.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3529	Zinc homeostasis		Zinc is a transition metal and catalytic cofactor involved in many biological processes such as proliferation, development and differentiation, regulation of DNA synthesis, genomic stability, cell activation, RNA transcription, immune function. Zinc homeostasis in cells is ensured by various protein families including zinc transporters, zinc-binding proteins (Metallothioneins, MTs), transcription factors (MTF1-2). ZnT (1-10) transporters are responsible of zinc efflux and are assigned to the SLC30A family while ZIP (1-14) transporters are responsible for the influx of zinc into the cytoplasm and are assigned to the SLC39A family. Zn2+ enters into the cell by the ZIP transporters, and once inside the cell is available to bind metalloproteins (MT) which deliver to ZnT, or the zinc can bind to directly ZnTs and then deliver in the organelles / vesicles or lead outside the cell. Elevated zinc levels have been reported in different tumour tissue, such as breast and lung cancer		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3545	NIK -&gt; non-canonical NF-kB signaling		In addition to the activation of canonical NF-kB subunits, activation of SYK pathway by Dectin-1 leads to the induction of the non-canonical NF-kB pathway, which mediates the nuclear translocation of RELB-p52 dimers through the successive activation of NF-kB-inducing kinase (NIK) and IkB kinase-alpha (IKKa) (Geijtenbeek & Gringhuis 2009, Gringhuis et al. 2009). Noncanonical activity tends to build more slowly and remain sustained several hours longer than does the activation of canonical NF-kB. The noncanonical NF-kB pathway is characterized by the post-translational processing of NFKB2 (Nuclear factor NF-kappa-B) p100 subunit to the mature p52 subunit. This subsequently leads to nuclear translocation of p52:RELB (Transcription factor RelB) complexes to induce cytokine expression of some genes (C-C motif chemokine 17 (CCL17) and CCL22) and transcriptional repression of others (IL12B) (Gringhuis et al. 2009, Geijtenbeek & Gringhuis 2009, Plato et al. 2013).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3547	Amyloid fiber formation		Amyloid is a term used to describe deposits of fibrillar proteins, typically extracellular. The abnormal accumulation of amyloid, amyloidosis, is a term associated with tissue damage caused by amyloid deposition, seen in numerous diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's. Amyloid deposits consist predominantly of amyloid fibrils, rigid, non-branching structures that form ordered assemblies, characteristically with a cross beta-sheet structure where the sheets run parallel to the direction of the fibril (Sawaya et al. 2007). Often the fibril has a left-handed twist (Nelson & Eisenberg 2006). At least 27 human proteins form amyloid fibrils (Sipe et al. 2010). Many of these proteins have non-pathological functions; the trigger that leads to abnormal aggregations differs between proteins and is not well understood but in many cases the peptides are abnormal fragments or mutant forms arising from polymorphisms, suggesting that the initial event may be aggregation of misfolded or unfolded peptides. Early studies of Amyloid-beta assembly led to a widely accepted model that assembly was a nucleation-dependent polymerization reaction (Teplow 1998) but it is now understood to be more complex, with multiple 'off-pathway' events leading to a variety of oligomeric structures in addition to fibrils (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008), though it is unclear whether these intermediate steps are required in vivo. An increasing body of evidence suggests that these oligomeric forms are primarily responsible for the neurotoxic effects of Amyloid-beta (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008), alpha-synuclein (Winner et al. 2011) and tau (Dance & Strobel 2009, Meraz-Rios et al. 2010). Amyloid oligomers are believed to have a common structural motif that is independent of the protein involved and not present in fibrils (Kayed et al. 2003). Conformation dependent, aggregation specific antibodies suggest that there are 3 general classes of amyloid oligomer structures (Glabe 2009) including annular structures which may be responsible for the widely reported membrane permeabilization effect of amyloid oligomers. Toxicity of amyloid oligomers preceeds the appearance of plaques in mouse models (Ferretti et al. 2011). <br>Fibrils are often associated with other molecules, notably heparan sulfate proteoglycans and Serum Amyloid P-component, which are universally associated and seem to stabilize fibrils, possibly by protecting them from degradation.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3549	Mitophagy		Mitophagy is a specific form of autophagy where mitochondria are specifically targeted for degradation by autophagolysosomes.. In mammals there are a number of known mechanisms of mitophagy. One insures maternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA through the elimination of sperm derived mitochondria. A second is elimination of functional mitochondria during erythrocyte maturation and eye lens maturation.  It is established that the outer mitochondrial membrane receptor Nix (or Bnip3l) and autophagosome associated protein LC3 are important for mitochondrial degradation in erythrocytes. A third mechanism is driven by the Pink1 and Parkin proteins. Parkin is recruited to the mitochondria when the mitochondrial membrane potential is reduced due to uncoupling, thereby initiating mitophagy.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3550	Nonhomologous End-Joining		The nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway is initiated in response to the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by DNA-damaging agents, such as ionizing radiation. DNA DSBs are recognized by the MRN complex (MRE11A:RAD50:NBN), leading to ATM activation and ATM-dependent recruitment of a number of DNA damage checkpoint and repair proteins to DNA DSB sites (Lee and Paull 2005). The ATM phosphorylated MRN complex, MDC1 and H2AFX-containing nucleosomes (gamma-H2AX) serve as scaffolds for the formation of nuclear foci known as ionizing radiation induced foci (IRIF) (Gatei et al. 2000, Paull et al. 2000, Stewart et al. 2003, Stucki et al. 2005). Ultimately, both BRCA1:BARD1 heterodimers and TP53BP1 (53BP1) are recruited to IRIF (Wang et al. 2007, Pei et al. 2011, Mallette et al. 2012), which is necessary for ATM-mediated CHEK2 activation (Wang et al. 2002, Wilson et al. 2008). In G1 cells, TP53BP1 promotes NHEJ by recruiting RIF1 and PAX1IP, which displaces BRCA1:BARD1 and associated proteins from the DNA DSB site and prevents resection of DNA DSBs needed for homologous recombination repair (HRR) (Escribano-Diaz et al. 2013, Zimmermann et al. 2013, Callen et al. 2013). TP53BP1 also plays an important role in ATM-mediated phosphorylation of DCLRE1C (ARTEMIS) (Riballo et al. 2004, Wang et al. 2014). Ku70:Ku80 heterodimer (also known as the Ku complex or XRCC5:XRCC6) binds DNA DSB ends, competing away the MRN complex and preventing MRN-mediated resection of DNA DSB ends (Walker et al. 2001, Sun et al. 2012). The catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs, PRKDC) is then recruited to DNA-bound Ku to form the DNA-PK holoenzyme. Two DNA-PK complexes, one at each side of the break, bring DNA DSB ends together, joining them in a synaptic complex (Gottlieb 1993, Yoo and Dynan 2000). DNA-PK complex recruits DCLRE1C (ARTEMIS) to DNA DSB ends (Ma et al. 2002). PRKDC-mediated phosphorylation of DCLRE1C, as well as PRKDC autophosphorylation, enables DCLRE1C to trim 3'- and 5'-overhangs at DNA DSBs, preparing them for ligation (Ma et al. 2002, Ma et al. 2005, Niewolik et al. 2006). The binding of inositol phosphate may additionally stimulate the catalytic activity of PRKDC (Hanakahi et al. 2000). Other factors, such as polynucleotide kinase (PNK), TDP1 or TDP2 may remove unligatable damaged nucleotides from 5'- and 3'-ends of the DSB, converting them to ligatable substrates (Inamdar et al. 2002, Gomez-Herreros et al. 2013). DNA ligase 4 (LIG4) in complex with XRCC4 (XRCC4:LIG4) is recruited to ligatable DNA DSB ends together with the XLF (NHEJ1) homodimer and DNA polymerases mu (POLM) and/or lambda (POLL) (McElhinny et al. 2000, Hsu et al. 2002, Malu et al. 2002, Ahnesorg et al. 2006, Mahajan et al. 2002, Lee et al. 2004, Fan and Wu 2004). After POLL and/or POLM fill 1- or 2-nucleotide long single strand gaps at aligned DNA DSB ends, XRCC4:LIG4 performs the ligation of broken DNA strands, thus completing NHEJ. The presence of NHEJ1 homodimer facilitates the ligation step, especially at mismatched DSB ends (Tsai et al. 2007). Depending on other types of DNA damage present at DNA DSBs, NHEJ can result in error-free products, produce dsDNA with microdeletions and/or mismatched bases, or result in translocations (reviewed by Povrik et al. 2012).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3551	ROS and RNS production in phagocytes		"The first line of defense against infectious agents involves an active recruitment of phagocytes to the site of infection. Recruited cells include polymorhonuclear (PMN) leukocytes (i.e., neutrophils) and monocytes/macrophages, which function together as innate immunity sentinels (Underhill DM & Ozinsky A 2002; Stuart LM & Ezekowitz RA 2005; Flannagan RS et al. 2012). Dendritic cells are also present, serving as important players in antigen presentation for ensuing adaptive responses (Savina A & Amigorena S 2007). These cell types are able to bind and engulf invading microbes into a membrane-enclosed vacuole - the phagosome, in a process termed phagocytosis. Phagocytosis can be defined as the receptor-mediated engulfment of particles greater than 0.5 micron in diameter. It is initiated by the cross-linking of host cell membrane receptors following engagement with their cognate ligands on the target surface (Underhill DM & Ozinsky A 2002; Stuart LM & Ezekowitz RA 2005; Flannagan RS et al. 2012). When engulfed by phagocytes, microorganisms are exposed to a number of host defense microbicidal events within the resulting phagosome. These include the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS, RONS) by specialized enzymes (Fang FC et al. 2004; Kohchi C et al. 2009; Gostner JM et al. 2013; Vatansever F et al. 2013). NADPH oxidase (NOX) complex consume oxygen to produce superoxide radical anion (O2.-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Robinson et al. 2004). Induced NO synthase (iNOS) is involved in the production of NO, which is the primary source of all RNS in biological systems (Evans TG et al. 1996). The phagocyte NADPH oxidase and iNOS are expressed in both PMN and mononuclear phagocytes and both cell types have the capacity for phagosomal burst activity. However, the magnitude of ROS generation in neutrophils far exceeds that observed in macrophages (VanderVen BC et al. 2009). Macrophages are thought to produce considerably more RNS than neutrophils (Fang FC et al. 2004; Nathan & Shiloh 2000).<p>The presence of RONS characterized by a relatively low reactivity, such as H2O2, O2Ë™âˆ’ or NO, has no deleterious effect on biological environment (Attia SM 2010; Weidinger A & and Kozlov AV 2015). Their activity is controlled by endogenous antioxidants (both enzymatic and non-enzymatic) that are induced by oxidative stress. However the relatively low reactive species can initiate a cascade of reactions to generate more damaging â€œsecondaryâ€� species such as hydroxyl radical (â€¢OH), singlet oxygen or peroxinitrite (Robinson JM 2008; Fang FC et al. 2004). These ""secondary"" RONS are extremely toxic causing irreversible damage to all classes of biomolecules (Weidinger A & and Kozlov AV 2015; Fang FC et al. 2004; Kohchi C et al. 2009; Gostner JM et al. 2013; Vatansever F et al. 2013).<p>Although macrophages and neutrophils use similar mechanisms for the internalization of targets, there are differences in how they perform phagocytosis and in the final outcome of the process (Tapper H & Grinstein S 1997; Vierira OV et al. 2002). Once formed, the phagosome undergoes an extensive maturation process whereby it develops into a microbicidal organelle able to eliminate the invading pathogen. Maturation involves re-modeling both the membrane of the phagosome and its luminal contents (Vierira OV et al. 2002). In macrophages, phagosome formation and maturation follows a series of strictly coordinated membrane fission/fusion events between the phagosome and compartments of the endo/lysosomal network gradually transforming the nascent phagosome into a phagolysosome, a degradative organelle endowed with potent microbicidal properties (Zimmerli S et al. 1996; Vierira OV et al. 2002). Neutrophils instead contain a large number of preformed granules such as azurophilic and specific granules that can rapidly fuse with phagosomes delivering antimicrobial substances (Karlsson A & Dahlgren C 2002; Naucler C et al. 2002; Nordenfelt P and Tapper H 2011). Phagosomal pH dynamics may also contribute to the maturation process by regulating membrane traffic events. The microbicidal activity of macrophages is characterized by progressive acidification of the lumen (down to pH 4â€“5) by the proton pumping vATPase. A low pH is a prerequisite for optimal enzymatic activity of most late endosomal/lysosomal hydrolases reported in macrophages. Neutrophil phagosome pH regulation differs significantly from what is observed in macrophages (Nordenfelt P and Tapper H 2011; Winterbourn CC et al. 2016). The massive activation of the oxidative burst is thought to result in early alkalization of neutrophil phagosomes which is linked to proton consumption during the generation of hydrogen peroxide (Segal AW et al. 1981; Levine AP et al. 2015). Other studies showed that neutrophil phagosome maintained neutral pH values before the pH gradually decreased (Jankowski A et al. 2002). Neutrophil phagosomes also exhibited a high proton leak, which was initiated upon activation of the NADPH oxidase, and this activation counteracted phagosomal acidification (Jankowski A et al. 2002).<p>The Reactome module describes ROS and RNS production by phagocytic cells. The module includes cell-type specific events, for example, myeloperoxidase (MPO)-mediated production of hypochlorous acid in neutrophils. It also highlights differences between phagosomal pH dynamics in neutrophils and macrophages. The module describes microbicidal activity of selective RONS such as hydroxyl radical or peroxynitrite. However, detection of any of these species in the phagosomal environment is subject to many uncertainties (NÃ¼sse O 2011; Erard M et al. 2018). The mechanisms by which reactive oxygen/nitrogen species kill pathogens in phagocytic immune cells are still not fully understood.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3552	tRNA processing in the nucleus		Genes encoding transfer RNAs are transcribed in the nucleus by RNA polymerase III. (Distinct processes of transcription and processing also occur in mitochondria.) The initial transcripts, pre-tRNAs, contain extra nucleotides at the 5' end and 3' end. 6.3% (32 of 509) of human tRNAs also contain introns, which are located in the anticodon loop, 3' to the anticodon. The additional nucleotides are removed and a non-templated CCA sequence is added to the resulting 3' terminus by processing reactions in the nucleus and cytosol (reviewed in Nakanishi and Nureki 2005, Phizicky and Hopper 2010).<br>The order of processing and nucleotide modification events may be different for different tRNAs and its analysis is complicated by a retrograde transport mechanism that can import tRNAs from the cytosol back to the nucleus (retrograde movement, Shaheen and Hopper 2005, reviewed in Phizicky  2005). Generally, the 5' leader of the pre-tRNA is removed first by endonucleolytic cleavage by the RNase P ribonucleoprotein complex, which contains a catalytic RNA (RNA H1 in humans) and at least 10 protein subunits (reviewed in Jarrous 2002, Xiao et al. 2002, Jarrous and Gopalan 2010).<br>The 3' trailer is then removed by RNase Z activity, a single protein in humans (reviewed in Maraia and Lamichhane 2011). ELAC2 is a RNase Z found in both nucleus and mitochondria. ELAC1 is found in the cytosol and may also act as an RNase Z. Human tRNA genes do not encode the universal acceptor 3' terminus CCA, instead it is added post-transcriptionally by TRNT1, an unusual polymerase that requires no nucleic acid template (reviewed in Xiong and Steitz 2006, Hou 2010, Tomita and Yamashita 2014).<br>In humans introns are spliced from intron-containing tRNAs in the nucleus by a two step mechanism that is distinct from mRNA splicing (reviewed in Popow et al. 2012, Lopes et al. 2015). The TSEN complex first cleaves 5' and 3' to the intron, generating a 2'3' cyclic phosphate on the 5' exon and a 5' hydroxyl group on the 3' exon. These two ends are ligated by a complex containing at least 6 proteins in a single reaction that both hydrolyzes the 2' phosphate bond and joins the 3' phosphate to the 5' hydroxyl. (In yeast the ligation and the hydrolysis of the 2' phosphate are separate reactions. The splicing reactions in yeast occur in the cytosol at the mitochondrial outer membrane.) <br>Mature transfer RNAs contain a large number of modified nucleotide residues that are produced by post-transcriptional modification reactions (reviewed in Li and Mason 2014). Depending on the specific tRNA these reactions may occur before or after splicing and before or after export from the nucleus to the cytosol.

The pathway of wybutosine synthesis begins with a templated guanosine residue and proceeds through 6 steps catalyzed by 5 enzymes: N1 methylation of guanosine, condensation of 1-methylguanosine with pyruvate to yield 4-demethylwyosine, addition of an aminocarboxypropyl group to yield yW-86, methylation of yW-86 to yield yW-72, methylation of yW-72 to yield yW-58, and methoxycarbonylation of yW-58 to yield wybutosine (reviewed in Young and Bandarian 2013, Perche-LetuvÃ©e et al. 2014). Wybutosine may further be modified by hydroxylation and methylation.

Polyamines are essential for the growth, the maintenance and the function of normal cells.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3556	Branched-chain amino acid catabolism		The branched-chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine, and valine, are all essential amino acids (i.e., ones required in the diet). They are major constituents of muscle protein. The breakdown of these amino acids starts with two common steps catalyzed by enzymes that act on all three amino acids: reversible transamination by branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase, and irreversible oxidative decarboxylation by the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. Isovaleryl-CoA is produced from leucine by these two reactions, alpha-methylbutyryl-CoA from isoleucine, and isobutyryl-CoA from valine. These acyl-CoA's undergo dehydrogenation, catalyzed by three different but related enzymes, and the breakdown pathways then diverge. Leucine is ultimately converted to acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate; isoleucine to acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA; and valine to succinyl-CoA. Under fasting conditions, substantial amounts of all three amino acids are generated by protein breakdown. In muscle, the final products of leucine, isoleucine, and valine catabolism can be fully oxidized via the citric acid cycle; in liver they can be directed toward the synthesis of ketone bodies (acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA) and glucose (succinyl-CoA) (Neinast et al. 2019).

So-called canonical WNTs, including Wnt1, 3, 3a and 7, initiate signaling pathways that destabilize the destruction complex and allow beta-catenin to accumulate and translocate to the nucleus where it promotes transcription (reviewed in Saito-Diaz et al, 2013).  Non-canonical WNTs, including Wnt 2, 4, 5a, 5b, 6, 7b, and Wnt11 activate beta-catenin-independent responses that regulate many aspects of morphogenesis and development, often by impinging on the cytoskeleton (reviewed in van Amerongen, 2012).  Two of the main beta-catenin-independent pathways are the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway, which controls the establishment of polarity in the plane of a field of cells, and the WNT/Ca2+ pathway, which promotes the release of intracellular calcium and regulates numerous downstream effectors (reviewed in Gao, 2012; De, 2011).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3560	Cargo concentration in the ER		Computational analysis suggests that ~25% of the proteome may be exported from the ER in human cells (Kanapin et al, 2003).  These cargo need to be recognized and concentrated into COPII vesicles, which range in size from 60-90 nm, and which move cargo from the ER to the ERGIC in mammalian cells (reviewed in Lord et al, 2013; Szul and Sztul, 2011). Recognition of transmembrane cargo is mediated by interaction with one of the 4 isoforms of SEC24, a component of the inner COPII coat (Miller et al, 2002; Miller et al, 2003; Mossessova et al, 2003; Mancias and Goldberg, 2008).  Soluble cargo in the ER lumen is concentrated into COPII vesicles through interaction with a receptor of the ERGIC-53 family, the p24 family or the ERV family. Each of these families of transmembrane receptors interact with cargo through their lumenal domains and with components of the COPII coat with their cytoplasmic domains and are packaged into the COPII vesicle along with the cargo.  The receptors are subsequently recycled to the ER in COPI vesicles through retrograde traffic (reviewed in Dancourt and Barlowe, 2010).  Packaging of large cargo such as fibrillar collagen depends on the transmembrane accessory factors MIA3 (also known as TANGO1) and CTAGE5.  Like the ERGIC, p24 and ERV cargo receptors, MIA3 and MIA2 (also known as CTAGE5) interact both with the collagen cargo and with components of the COPII coat. Unlike the other cargo receptors, however, MIA3 and MIA2 are not loaded into the vesicle but remain in the ER membrane (reviewed in Malhotra and Erlmann, 2011; Malhotra et al, 2015).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3561	tRNA modification in the nucleus and cytosol		At least 92 distinct tRNA nucleotide base modifications have been found. The modifications are made post-transcriptionally by a large group of disparate enzymes located in the nucleus, cytosol, and mitochondria (reviewed in Boschi-Muller and Motorin 2013, Jackman and Alfonzo 2013, Gu et al. 2014, Helm and Alfonzo 2014, Li and Mason 2014). Modifications near the anticodon and near the 3' end affect interaction of the tRNA with ribosomes and tRNA synthetases, respectively, while modifications in other regions of the tRNA affect folding and stability of the tRNA (reviewed in Hou et al. 2015). Mutations in tRNA modification enzymes are associated with human diseases (reviewed in Sarin and Leidel 2014, Torres et al. 2014).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3562	Glyoxylate metabolism and glycine degradation		Glyoxylate is generated in the course of glycine and hydroxyproline catabolism and can be converted to oxalate. In humans, this process takes place in the liver. Defects in two enzymes of glyoxylate metabolism, alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGXT) and glycerate dehydrogenase/glyoxylate reductase (GRHPR), are associated with pathogenic overproduction of oxalate (Danpure 2005). The reactions that interconvert glycine, glycolate, and glyoxylate and convert glyoxylate to oxalate have been characterized in molecular detail in humans. A reaction sequence for the conversion of hydroxyproline to glyoxylate has been inferred from studies of partially purified extracts of rat and bovine liver but the enzymes involved in the corresponding human reactions have not been identified.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3565	DNA Damage/Telomere Stress Induced Senescence		Reactive oxygen species (ROS), whose concentration increases in senescent cells due to oncogenic RAS-induced mitochondrial dysfunction (Moiseeva et al. 2009) or due to environmental stress, cause DNA damage in the form of double strand breaks (DSBs) (Yu and Anderson 1997). In addition, persistent cell division fueled by oncogenic signaling leads to replicative exhaustion, manifested in critically short telomeres (Harley et al. 1990, Hastie et al. 1990). Shortened telomeres are no longer able to bind the protective shelterin complex (Smogorzewska et al. 2000, de Lange 2005) and are recognized as damaged DNA. <p>The evolutionarily conserved MRN complex, consisting of MRE11A (MRE11), RAD50 and NBN (NBS1) subunits, binds DSBs (Lee and Paull 2005) and shortened telomeres that are no longer protected by shelterin (Wu et al. 2007). Once bound to the DNA, the MRN complex recruits and activates ATM kinase (Lee and Paull 2005, Wu et al. 2007), leading to phosphorylation of ATM targets, including TP53 (p53) (Banin et al. 1998, Canman et al. 1998, Khanna et al. 1998). TP53, phosphorylated on serine S15 by ATM, binds the CDKN1A (also known as p21, CIP1 or WAF1) promoter and induces CDKN1A transcription (El-Deiry et al. 1993, Karlseder et al. 1999). CDKN1A inhibits the activity of CDK2, leading to G1/S cell cycle arrest (Harper et al. 1993, El-Deiry et al. 1993).<p>SMURF2 is upregulated in response to telomere attrition in human fibroblasts and induces senecscent phenotype through RB1 and TP53, independently of its role in TGF-beta-1 signaling (Zhang and Cohen 2004). The exact mechanism of SMURF2 involvement is senescence has not been elucidated.   View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=2559586 Reactome].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3567	HDR through Homologous Recombination or Single Strand Annealing		Homology directed repair (HDR) of replication-independent DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) via homologous recombination repair (HRR) or single strand annealing (SSA) requires the activation of ATM followed by ATM-mediated phosphorylation of DNA repair proteins. ATM coordinates the recruitment of DNA repair and signaling proteins to DSBs and formation of the so-called ionizing radiation induced foci (IRIF). While IRIFs include chromatin regions kilobases away from the actual DSB, this Reactome pathway represents simplified foci and shows events that happen at the very ends of the broken DNA.<p>For both HRR and SSA to occur, the ends of the DNA DSB must be processed (resected) to generate lengthy 3' ssDNA tails, and the resulting ssDNA coated with RPA complexes, triggering ATR activation and signaling.<p>After the resection step, BRCA2 and RAD51 trigger HRR, a very accurate process in which the 3'-ssDNA overhang invades a sister chromatid, base pairs with the complementary strand of the sister chromatid DNA duplex, creating a D-loop, and uses the complementary sister chromatid strand as a template for DNA repair synthesis that bridges the DSB.<p>The SSA is triggered when 3'-ssDNA overhangs created in the resection step contain highly homologous direct repeats. In a process involving RAD52, the direct repeats in each 3'-ssDNA overhang become annealed, the unannealed 3'-flaps excised, and structures then processed by DNA repair synthesis. SSA results in the loss of one of the annealed repeats and the DNA sequence between the two repeats. Therefore, SSA is error-prone and is probably used as a backup for HRR, with RAD52 loss-of-function mutations being synthetically lethal with mutations in HRR genes, such as BRCA2 (reviewed by Ciccia and Elledge 2010).

The cytoplasmic domain of Fas interacts with a number of molecules in the transduction of the external signal to the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane. The most notable cytoplasmic domain is the Death Domain (DD) that is involved in recruiting the FAS-associating death domain-containing protein (FADD). This interaction drives downstream events.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3569	Fanconi Anemia Pathway		Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disease of genome instability characterized by congenital skeletal defects, aplastic anemia, susceptibility to leukemias, and cellular sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. Patients with FA have been categorized into at least 15 complementation groups (FA-A, -B, -C, -D1, -D2, -E, -F, -G, -I, -J, -L, -M, -N, -O and -P). These complementation groups correspond to the genes FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCJ/BRIP1, FANCL, FANCM, FANCN/PALB2, FANCO/RAD51C and FANCP/SLX4. Eight of these proteins, FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL, and FANCM, together with FAAP24, FAAP100, FAAP20, APITD1 and STRA13, form a nuclear complex termed the FA core complex. The FA core complex is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that recognizes and is activated by DNA damage in the form of interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), triggering monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI, which initiates repair of ICL-DNA.<p>FANCD2 and FANCI form a complex and are mutually dependent on one another for their respective monoubiquitination. After DNA damage and during S phase, FANCD2 localizes to discrete nuclear foci that colocalize with proteins involved in homologous recombination repair, such as BRCA1 and RAD51. The FA pathway is regulated by ubiquitination and phosphorylation of FANCD2 and FANCI. ATR-dependent phosphorylation of FANCI and FANCD2 promotes monoubiquitination of FANCD2, stimulating the FA pathway (Cohn and D'Andrea 2008, Wang 2007). The complex of USP1 and WDR48 (UAF1) is responsible for deubiquitination of FANCD2 and negatively regulates the FA pathway (Cohn et al. 2007). <p>Monoubiquitinated FANCD2 recruits DNA nucleases, including SLX4 (FANCP) and FAN1, which unhook the ICL from one of the two covalently linked DNA strands. The DNA polymerase nu (POLN) performs translesion DNA synthesis using the DNA strand with unhooked ICL as a template, thereby bypassing the unhooked ICL. The unhooked ICL is subsequently removed from the DNA via nucleotide excision repair (NER). Incision of the stalled replication fork during the unhooking step generates a double strand break (DSB). The DSB is repaired via homologous recombination repair (HRR) and involves the FA genes BRCA2 (FANCD1), PALB2 (FANCN) and BRIP1 (FANCJ) (reviewed by Deans and West 2011, Kottemann and Smogorzewska 2013). Homozygous mutations in BRCA2, PALB2 or BRIP1 result in Fanconi anemia, while heterozygous mutations in these genes predispose carriers to primarily breast and ovarian cancer. Well established functions of BRCA2, PALB2 and BRIP1 in DNA repair are BRCA1 dependent, but it is not yet clear whether there are additional roles for these proteins in the Fanconi anemia pathway that do not rely on BRCA1 (Evans and Longo 2014, Jiang and Greenberg 2015). Heterozygous BRCA1 mutations predispose carriers to breast and ovarian cancer with high penetrance. Complete loss of BRCA1 function is embryonic lethal. It has only recently been reported that a partial germline loss of BRCA1 function via mutations that diminish protein binding ability of the BRCT domain of BRCA1 result in a FA-like syndrome. BRCA1 has therefore been designated as the FANCS gene (Jiang and Greenberg 2015).<p>The FA pathway is involved in repairing DNA ICLs that arise by exposure to endogenous mutagens produced as by-products of normal cellular metabolism, such as aldehyde containing compounds. Disruption of the aldehyde dehydrogenase gene ALDH2 in FANCD2 deficient mice leads to severe developmental defects, early lethality and predisposition to leukemia. In addition to this, the double knockout mice are exceptionally sensitive to ethanol consumption, as ethanol metabolism results in accumulated levels of aldehydes (Langevin et al. 2011).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3570	HDR through MMEJ (alt-NHEJ)		Homology directed repair (HDR) through microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) is an error prone process also known as alternative nonhomologous end joining (alt-NHEJ), although it does not involve proteins that participate in the classical NHEJ. Contrary to the classical NHEJ and other HDR pathways, homologous recombination repair (HRR) and single strand annealing (SSA), MMEJ does not require ATM activation. In fact, ATM activation inhibits MMEJ. Therefore, MMEJ may be triggered when the amount of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) overwhelms DNA repair machinery of higher fidelity or when cells are deficient in components of high fidelity DNA repair.<p>MMEJ is initiated by a limited resection of DNA DSB ends by the MRN complex (MRE11A:RAD50:NBN) and RBBP8 (CtIP), in the absence of CDK2-mediated RBBP8 phosphorylation and related BRCA1:BARD1 recruitment (Yun and Hiom 2009). Single strand DNA (ssDNA) at resected DNA DSB ends recruits PARP1 or PARP2 homo- or heterodimers, together with DNA polymerase theta (POLQ) and FEN1 5'-flap endonuclease. In a poorly studied sequence of events, POLQ promotes the annealing of two 3'-ssDNA overhangs through microhomologous regions that are optimally 10-19 nucleotides long. Using analogy with POLB-mediated long patch base excision repair (BER), it is plausible that PARP1 (or PARP2) dimers coordinate the extension of annealed 3'-ssDNA overhangs via POLQ-mediated strand displacement synthesis with FEN1-mediated cleavage of the resulting 5'-flaps (Liang et al. 2005, Mansour et al. 2011, Sharma et al. 2015, Kent et al. 2015, Ciccaldi et al. 2015, Mateos-Gomez et al. 2015). The MRN complex subsequently recruits DNA ligase 3 (LIG3) bound to XRCC1 (LIG3:XRCC1) to ligate the remaining single strand nicks (SSBs) at MMEJ sites (Della-Maria et al. 2011).<p>Similar to single strand annealing (SSA), MMEJ leads to deletion of one of the microhomology regions used for annealing and the DNA sequence in between two annealed microhomology regions. MMEJ, just like classical NHEJ, can result in genomic translocations (Ghezraoui et al. 2014). In addition, since POLQ is an error-prone DNA polymerase, MMEJ introduces frequent base substitutions (Ceccaldi et al. 2015).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3575	Endosomal sorting complex required for transport		Many plasma membrane proteins are in a constant flux throughout the internal trafficking pathways of the cell. Some receptors are continuously internalized into recycling endosomes and returned to the cell surface. Others are sorted into intralumenal vesicles of morphologically distinctive endosomes that are known as multivesicular bodies (MVBs). These MVBs fuse with lysosomes, resulting in degradation of their cargo by lysosomal acidic hydrolases.<br>Endosomes can be operationally defined as being either early or late, referring to the relative time it takes for endocytosed material to reach either stage. Ultrastructural studies indicate that early endosomes are predominantly tubulovesicular structures, which constitute a major sorting platform in the cell, whereas late endosomes show the characteristics of typical MVBs and are capable of fusing with lysosomes.<br>A well characterized signal for shunting membrane proteins into the degradative MVB pathway is the ubiquitylation of these cargoes. At the center of a vast protein:protein and protein:lipid interaction network that underpins ubiquitin mediated sorting to the lysosome are the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs), which are conserved throughout all major eukaryotic taxa.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3577	Class I MHC mediated antigen processing and presentation		Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules play an important role in cell mediated immunity by reporting on intracellular events such as viral infection, the presence of intracellular bacteria or tumor-associated antigens. They bind peptide fragments of these proteins and presenting them to CD8+ T cells at the cell surface. This enables cytotoxic T cells to identify and eliminate cells that are synthesizing abnormal or foreign proteins. MHC class I is a trimeric complex composed of a polymorphic heavy chain (HC or alpha chain) and an invariable light chain, known as beta2-microglobulin (B2M) plus an 8-10 residue peptide ligand. Represented here are the events in the biosynthesis of MHC class I molecules, including generation of antigenic peptides by the ubiquitin/26S-proteasome system, delivery of these peptides to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), loading of peptides to MHC class I molecules and display of MHC class I complexes on the cell surface.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3578	trans-Golgi Network Vesicle Budding		After passing through the Golgi complex, secretory cargo is packaged into post-Golgi transport intermediates (post-Golgi), which translocate plus-end directed along microtubules to the plasma membrane.There at least two classes of clathrin coated vesicles in cells, one predominantly Golgi-associated, involved in budding from the trans-Golgi network and the other at the plasma membrane. Here the clathrin-coated vesicles emerging from the Golgi apparatus are triggered by the heterotetrameric adaptor protein complex, AP-1 at the trans-Golgi network membrane. The cargo can be transmembrane, membrane associated or golgi luminal proteins. Each step in the vesicle sculpting pathway, gathers cargo and clathrin triskeletons, until a complete vesicular sphere is formed. With the scission of the membrane the vesicle is released and eventually losses its clathrin coat. View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=199992 Reactome].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3579	Surfactant metabolism		The alveolar region of the lung creates an extensive epithelial surface that mediates the transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide required for respiration after birth. Type I epithelial cells form the alveolar surface and mediate gaseous exchange. Type II epithelial cells secrete pulmonary surfactant, a lipoprotein complex that forms a thin interfacial film, lowering surface tension at the air-liquid interface in alveoli and maintaining the structural integrity of alveoli, preventing their collapse at low volumes (Agassandian & Mallampalli 2013). Surfactant production is increased prior to birth, in preparation for air breathing at birth (Hallman 2013). Pre-term infants, where type II epithelial cells are not fully differentiated yet, can produce insufficient surfactant and result in respiratory distress syndrome. Surfactant is composed primarily of phospholipids enriched in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (Agassandian & Mallampalli 2013) and the pulmonary collectins, termed surfactant proteins A, B, C and D (SFTPA-D). They influence surfactant homeostasis, contributing to the physical structures of lipids in the alveoli and to the regulation of surfactant function and metabolism. They are directly secreted from alveolar type II cells into the airway to function as part of the surfactant. SFTPA and D are large, hydrophilic proteins while SFTPB and C are small, very hydrophobic proteins (Johansson et al. 1994). In addition to their surfactant functions, SFTPA and D play important roles in innate host defense by binding and clearing invading microbes from the lung (Kingma & Whitsett 2006). Nuclear regulation, transport, metabolism, reutilisation and degradation of surfactant are described here (Ikegami 2006, Boggaram 2009, Whitsett et al. 2010). Mutations in genes involved in these processes can result in respiratory distress syndrome, lung proteinosis, interstitial lung diseases and chronic lung diseases (Perez-Gil & Weaver 2010, Whitsett et al. 2010, Akella & Deshpande 2013, Jo 2014).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3584	MECP2 and associated Rett syndrome		MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) is in many mammals an important regulator of neuronal function and development. It affects all cell types, especially neurons but also astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and glial cells. MECP2 plays an important role in neuronal differentiation, maturation, morphology and function and influences synaptic plasticity. Mutations impairing the proper function of MECP2 are mainly associated with the Rett syndrome but may also contribute to other neurological disorders like schizophrenia, FASD (fetal alcohol syndrome), PPM-X-syndrome, autism, Prader-Will-syndrome, and Angelman-syndrome. Dependant on the cofactors MECP2 acts as an activator or repressor of transcription and micro RNA production. It affects RNA splicing and regulates chromatin structure together with HP1 and interferes in methylation of DNA (epigenetics). The expression of MECP2 itself is highly regulated by promotor elements, cis-regulatory elements, polyadenylation, promotor DNA methylation and miRNA.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3585	Cytosine methylation		DNA, namely cytosine, methylation is the key event in epigentics. The degree of methylation influences gene expression and methylation disorders are known to be major causes of some diseases like Rett syndrome and some cancer types. Epigenetic effects also contribute to the development of Alzheimers' disease, developmental retardation by alcohol, Huntington's disease and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Methylation is not a static event but a highly dynamic and therefore highly regulated procedure. Cytosine is methylated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) forming 5-methylcytosine (5mC). In a second step, 5mC is transformed to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by ten-eleven-translocation enzymes (TET1-3). These enzymes are sensitive to regulation by a variety of metabolites (ethanol, a-ketoglutarate, 2-hydroxyglutarate), miRNA and MeCP2 (targeting directly TET1). Proteins binding methylated DNA like MeCP2 or Mbd3 (as part of the NURD complex) also inhibit the conversion by blocking the target. MeCP2 also binds on 5hmC and block the transition to 5-formylcytosine (5fC) which is also catalyzed by the TET enzymes. The conversion back to cytosine is done by tymine DNA glycosylase (TGD) and base excision repair mechanism either directly or over another TET catalyzed step forming 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC).		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP363	Wnt signaling pathway		"WNT signal, through the canonical pathway, controls cell fate determination and through the non-canonical pathway controls cell movement and tissue polarity. The name ""wnt"" is a fusion of two terms, wg derived from the Drosophila gene wingless (wg) and int derived from the proto-oncogene integration-1, which is the mammalian homolog of wg. ÃŸ-catenin is the key regulated effector of Wnt, involved in canonical signaling . Free ÃŸ-catenin is bound by a multiprotein ""destruction complex"". The ÃŸ-catenin destruction complex is comprised of ÃŸ-catenin, scaffold proteins (APC, AXIN) and serine/threonine kinases that phosphorylate ÃŸ-catenin casein kinase 1 (CSNK1A1, CSNK1D, CSNK1E, CSNK1G1) and GSK3B. The sequential phosphorylation of ÃŸ-catenin by casein kinase 1 and GSK3 is recognised by an SCF-class E3-ubiquitin ligase, which targets it for polyubiquitination and proteosomal destruction. Canonical WNT signals are transduced through a two-part receptor, a seven-transmembrane Frizzled (FZD) and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/LRP6) to a ÃŸ-catenin (CTNNB1) signaling cascade. On recruitment of deshevelled (DVL1) to FZD and AXIN to LRP6, ÃŸ-catenin destruction complex disassembles leading to its stabilization and nuclear accumulation. Nuclear ÃŸ-catenin binds to T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family of transcription factors and Legless family docking protein, BCL9. These activate the transcription of Wnt target genes CCND1, MYC. Non-canonical WNT signaling diverges downstream after being transduced through FZD family receptors and co-receptors, ROR2 and RYK. This pathway does not involve ÃŸ-catenin-mediated gene expression. Small G proteins such as RAC1, RHOA and downstream effectors of RAC including JNK are DVL-dependant effector molecules of the non-canonical pathway. These have been implicated in cytoskeletal rearrangement, dendrite growth and control of cell polarity and orientation. Nemo-like kinase (NLK) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) are Ca2+-dependant effectors of the non-canonical pathway. NLK inhibits canonical pathway by phosphorylation of TCF/LEF family transcription factors. NFAT transcription factor is implicated in convergent extension during early embryogenesis and carcinogenic metastasis.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3630	NAD metabolism, sirtuins and aging		A model for DNA damage, inflammation, NAD+, and aging.Two key events, the activation of PARP by DNA damage and the decreased NAMPT expression associated with inflammation, lead to decreased SIRT1 and SIRT3 activity in the nucleus and mitochondria, respectively. Decreased SIRT1 activity is associated with further PARP activation and increased DNA damage. Decreased SIRT1 also leads to NF-kB activation and decreased FOXO3a activity, two factors that lead to increased inflammation. These contribute to the establishment of two parallel feed-forward self reinforcing loops that further accelerate the aging process. This process is initiated earlier and faster in patients with DNA damage repair defects (such as CS, XPA, and AT). Mitochondrial function is diminished as a result of decreased SIRT3 activity, leading to mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation, whereas decreased SIRT1 is associated with decreased TFAM (necessary for mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription) and decreased PGC-1a (necessary for mitochondrial biogenesis). Possible therapeutic interventions to restore NAD+ levels are illustrated for each of the key enzymes (red arrows).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP364	IL6 signaling pathway		IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine with important role in immune regulation, hematopoiesis, inflammation and oncogenesis. IL-6-type cytokines exert their action via the signal transducer gp130 that associates with IL6R in a cooperative manner to form a hexameric signal transducing complex, capable of activating the down stream mediators of this signaling pathway. This mechanism of signal transduction is shared by other members of the IL-6 type cytokines like IL-11, leukaemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor and cardiotrophin-1 that use gp130 as a common subunit of the signal transducing complex. IL-6 stimulation leads to the activation of JAK/STAT pathway. Both STAT1 and STAT3 are phosphorylated and are able to form homo- and heterodimers after activation leading to their nuclear localization and subsequent regulation of transcription of respective target genes. SHP-2 is one of the ubiquitous tyrosine phosphatases and IL-6 stimulation leads to the SHP2-dependent activation of MAPKs, it also links the Grb2-SOS complex and Gab1 to gp130. Phosphorylated Gab1 acts as an adapter and is involved in the indirect association of SHP-2 and PI-3 kinase. Downstream activation of Vav1, Rac-1 and MAP2K4 is necessary for the IL-6-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation and transactivation to accomplish its effects. STAT3 is also phosphorylated by PKCD and it causes inhibition of STAT3 DNA binding and transcriptional activity. PTPN11 and SOCS3 exert inhibitory function and thus lead to down regulation of the signaling cascade.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_6_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite the following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3640	Imatinib and chronic myeloid leukemia		Hematopoietic Stem Cells found in bone marrow can differentiate into Monocytes and Erythrocytes, or in the case of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), they can continue to proliferate, undifferentiated, in blood. CML is caused by the Philadelphia translocation (Ph), which puts ABL behind BCR. The BRC-ABL fusion is a constitutively on tyrosine kinase that indirectly counteracts erythroid differentiation, thus promoting the continued proliferation underlying CML. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that binds ABL and in turn promotes healthy erythroid differentiation by counteracting BRC-ABL activity. Imatinib resistance can be conferred by the over-expression of ABC drug transporters and competitive binding kinases.The pathway diagram above aligns molecules with the cell fates they promote, to help keep track of inhibition-of-inhibition-of-inhibition sequences, for example. The known mechanisms of imatinib resistance are at the bottom, under CML cell fate and are shown interacting with imatinib, which is under the erythrocyte cell fate.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3644	NAD+ metabolism		NAD+ metabolism in different cellular compartments. The different precursors to intracellular NAD metabolism - tryptophan, nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide, NR, and NMN - are shown, along with their extra-cellular metabolism by CD38 and CD73. The cytoplasmic and nuclear NAD+ pools probably equilibrate by diffusion through the nuclear pore. However, the mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to both NAD+ and NADH. Reducing equivalents generated by glycolysis are transferred to the mitochondrial matrix via the malate/aspartate shuttle and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate shuttle. The resulting mitochondrial NADH (malate/aspartate shuttle) is oxidized by complex I in the electron transport chain, whereas the resulting FADH2 (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate shuttle) is oxidized by complex II. In each of the three compartments, different NAD+-consuming enzymes lead to the generation of nicotinamide, which is recycled via the NAD+ salvage pathway. Different forms of the NMNAT enzyme and sirtuins are localized in different compartments. The nature of the salvage pathway for NAD+ in mitochondria has not been fully resolved, although NMNAT3 has been found in mitochondria.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3644 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3645	NAD+ biosynthetic pathways		NAD+ biosynthetic pathways. NAD+ levels are maintained by three independent pathways. First, the Preiss-Handler pathway uses dietary nicotinic acid and the enzyme nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT) to generate NAMN, which is then transformed into NAAD by NAMN transferase (NMNAT). Three forms of this enzyme (NMNAT1, -2, and -3) have distinct subcellular localizations. The process is completed by the transformation of NAAD into NAD+ by NAD+ synthase (NADS). Second, the de novo synthesis pathway of NAD from tryptophan occurs through the kinurenine pathway (5). The first step in this pathway is the rate-limiting conversion of tryptophan to N-formylkinurenine (N-formylkin) by either IDO or TDO. Formylkinurenine is transformed into L-kinurenine (L-kin), 3-hydroxykinurenine, and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) and finally to ACMS. This compound can spontaneously condense and rearrange into quinolinic acid, which is transformed into NAMN, at which point it converges with the Preiss-Handler pathway. ACMS can also be decarboxylated into AMS by ACMS decarboxylase (ACMSD), leading to its oxidation into acetyl-CoA via the TCA cycle. Third, the NAD+ salvage pathway recycles the nicotinamide generated as a by-product of the enzymatic activities of NAD+-consuming enzymes: sirtuins, PARPs, and the cADPR synthases (CD38 and CD157). Initially, NAMPT recycles nicotinamide into NMN, which is then converted into NAD+ via the different NMNATs.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3645 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3651	Pathways affected in adenoid cystic carcinoma		Protein pathways altered by mutations in adenoid cystic carcinoma. Pathways include epigentic modification, DNA damage checkpoint signals, MYB/MYC signalling pathway, FGF/IGF/PI3K signalling, and notch signalling. In the epigenetic modification pathway, several complexes promote the activity of HIST1H1E/HIST1H2AL which regulate chromatin remodeling. In the DNA damage pathway DNA damage in the nucleus signals to ATM and PRKDC to induce DNA repair and suspend the cell cycle. ATM further activates proteins that induce either apoptosis or DNA repair and leads to the activation of proteins that inhibit progression in the cell cycle. The MYB/MYC pathway involves the activation of protein complexes involved in inducing cell growth and proliferation by CREBBP and MYCBP. However this pathway has feedback inhibition by the binding of the MYBL1/MYB complex to NFIB which depresses MYB activity. The FGF/IGF/PI3K signalling pathway involves the activation of the FGFR4/INSRR complex by FGF16 and ERBB2 activation by ERBB2IP which leads to a signalling cascade that inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell growth and migration. The notch pathway is activated by the biding of CNTN6 to Notch leading to pathway activation. This pathway is regulated by RoxP2, CTBP1, and DTX4/FBXW7.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP366	TGF-beta signaling pathway		"The signal transduction mechanisms underlying the pathophysiological activities of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) have been extensively studied since its discovery nearly 30 years ago. TGF-β ligands belong to a large superfamily of cytokines that bears its name (TGF-β Superfamily) and includes bone morphogenic proteins, activins, inhibin, growth/differentiation factors, Mullerian inhibiting substance, Nodal, and several other structurally-related polypeptides. Mammals express three TGF-β isoforms (i.e., TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3) that are encoded by distinct genes in a tissue-specific and developmentally-regulated manner. TGF-β was identified originally via its stimulation of morphological transformation and anchorage-independent growth in fibroblasts; however, this cytokine is now recognized as being a potent tumor suppressor that prevents the dysregulated growth and survival of epithelial, endothelial, and hematopoietic cells. In addition, numerous studies have clearly established TGF-β as a multifunctional cytokine that plays essential roles in regulating virtually all aspects of mammalian development and differentiation, and in maintaining mammalian tissue homeostasis. The pleiotropic nature of TGF-β is highlighted by the fact that every cell in the metazoan body can produce and respond to this cytokine. Even more remarkably, malignant cells have evolved a variety of complex mechanisms capable of circumventing the tumor suppressing activities of TGF-β, and in doing so, typically convert the functions of TGF-β to that of a tumor promoter, particularly the induction of carcinoma epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and dissemination to distant organ sites. This peculiar conversion in TGF-β function is known as the ""TGF-β Paradox"", which underlies the lethality of TGF-β in metastatic cancer cells. Thus, elucidating the effectors and signaling modules activated by TGF-β may offer new insights into the development of novel neoadjuvants capable of effectively targeting the TGF-β pathway to significantly improve the clinical course of patients with cancer, fibrosis, or immunologic disorders. TGF-β is secreted from cells as a latent homodimeric polypeptide that becomes tethered to the extracellular matrix by latent-TGF-β-binding proteins. Mature TGF-β isoforms are activated and liberated from extracellular matrix depots by a variety of mechanisms, including proteolysis, reactive oxygen species, changes in pH, and physical interactions with integrins, thromobspondin-1, or SPARC. Once activated, mature TGF-β initiates transmembrane signaling by binding to two distinct transmembrane Ser/Thr protein kinases, termed TGF-β type I (TβR-I) and type II (TβR-II) receptors. In some cells and tissues, TGF-β also binds to a third cell surface receptor, TGF-β type III (TβR-III), which transfers TGF-β to TβR-II and TβR-I. Full activation of these cytokine:receptor ternary complexes transpires upon TβR-II-mediated transphosphorylation and activation of TβR-I, which then phosphorylates and activates the latent transcription factors, Smad2 and Smad3. Afterward, phosphorylated Smad2/3 interact physically with Smad4, with the resulting heterotrimers translocating into the nucleus to regulate the expression of TGF-β-responsive genes. These Smad-dependent events are subject to fine-tuning and crosstalk regulation in the cytoplasm by their interaction with a variety of adapter molecules, including SARA, Hgs, PML and Dab2, and with Smad7, whose inhibitory activity is modulated by STRAP, AMSH2, and Arkadia; and in the nucleus by their interaction with a variety of transcriptional activators and repressors that occur in a gene- and cell-specific manner. In addition to activating canonical Smad2/3-dependent signaling, accumulating evidence clearly links the development of a variety of human pathologies to aberrant coupling of TGF-β to its noncanonical effector molecules. Included in this ever expanding list of noncanonical signaling molecules stimulated by TGF-β are PI3K, AKT, mTOR, integrins and focal adhesion kinase, and members of the MAP kinase (e.g., ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK small GTP-binding proteins (e.g., Ras, Rho, and Rac1). The interactions and intersections between canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signaling systems are depicted in the pathway map.Please access this pathway at NetSlim database.If you use this pathway, please cite the following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3664	Regulation of Wnt / B-catenin signaling by small molecule compounds		The Wnt/B-catenin pathway begins with Wnt family activation by MBOAT that allows Wnt proteins to translocate out of a cell and bind to FZD and LRP to form a complex. This complex stimulates B-catenin to bind to the TF/LEF complex to regulate gene expression in the cell. Regulation of this pathway takes place at different levels. The Wnt signaling can be inhibited by DKK3, FZD7, SFRP4, FZD8, V3Nter, and Wnt antibodies or FZD antibodies that inhibit FZD and do not allow formation of FZD/LRP/Wnt complex. Another level of regulation is the destruction complex (TNKS/AXIN/GSK3B/APC/CK1a/CK1e) that is regulated by XAV939, DVL, IC261, and Pyrvinium to catalyze the breakdown of B-catenin, inhibiting its binding to the TCF/LEF complex. Several substances including retinoids, glucocorticoids, and ICG-001 inhibit the TCF/LEF complex to stop Wnt/B-catenin signaling pathways from promoting gene transcription.

Using a conditional Tgif1 allele, Taniguchi, et al. showed that mouse embryos lacking both Tgif1 and the related Tgif2 have HPE-like phenotypes reminiscent of Shh null embryos.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3676	BDNF-TrkB signaling		Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important neurotrophin for the regulation of synaptic activity. BDNF-TrkB signaling, TrkB being the receptor of BDNF, is involved in transcription, translation, and trafficking of proteins in the various stages of synaptic development and evidence indicates that it also plays a significant role in synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time. Synaptic plasticity has been associated with learning and memory development. These functions are carried out through three pathways: mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phospholipase CG (PLC/PLCG), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Pi3K and MAPK have crucial roles in the protein translation and transport caused by synaptic activity. PLCG regulates intracellular levels of Ca2+, which drives gene transcription through cyclic AMP. Evidence strongly indicates that abnormal levels of BDNF leads to significant developmental and neurodegenerative diseases by disrupting neural development and function. An understanding of how the BDNF-TrkB pathway regulates synaptic activity and plasticity is essential to an understanding of how we can effectively treat genetic disruptions of this pathway that lead to terrible neurodevelopmental diseases.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3676 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3678	Amplification and expansion of oncogenic pathways as metastatic traits		"This pathway is based on Figure 4 of ""Origins of metastatic traits.""(See Bibliography).The majority of cancer cells released from tumors die off, so cancer biologists are trying to figure out exactly what gives certain cells the ability to colonize other distant organs. Specific genes and mediators of metastasis have been identified, but it remains mostly unknown how cancer cells acquire these traits.Metastatic traits acquired by a quantitative gain in pathway output: These pathways demonstrate metastatic traits acquired by a quantitative gain in pathway output. The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which is augmented by VCAM-1 and SRC, leads to increased cell survival, a significant metastatic trait. Similarly, TCF augments the output of the NOTCH and, along with periostin, Wnt signaling pathways. As the signaling of these pathways increases, the metastatic and oncogenic potential of the cell also increase.Metastatic traits acquired by a qualitative expansion of pathway output: This pathway demonstrates metastatic traits acquired by a qualitative expansion of pathway output. Loss of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) in renal cell carcinoma leads to increased activation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs). Histone H3K27 and CYTIP give the VHL-HIF pathway access to new target genes. Each of these new target genes, in this case CXCR4, VEGFA, and CYTIP, lead to an increase in a metastatic trait. Here, the level of metastatic fitness is not linearly proportional to pathway activity; rather, the pathway activates an additional set of factors that affect metastatic fitness.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3678 CPTAC Assay Portal]"		9606

CCK, CCK2R, and CB1R have all been known to have substantial effects on anxiety and other mood disorders, and the PV+ interneurons have also been shown to be involved i na variety of cognitive functions. However,  In PV+ basket cells and CCK+ basket cells, the CCK2 receptor uses different pathways to exert different effects on the two types of basket cells. For CCK+ basket cells, CCK2 receptors in neighboring pyramidal cells act through the Gq pathway to form endocannabinoids, which, through the cannabinoid receptor type 1 on the CCK+ basket cell, inhibit the release of the neurotransmitter GABA. In contrast, for PV+ basket cells, CCK2 receptors act through the pertussin-toxin sensitive Gi pathway to regulate the intracellular Ca2+ through ryanodine receptors. This pathway ultimately leads to activation of a non-selective cationic conductance to depolarize the PV+ basket cells."		9606

Full arrows represent a direct link (most likely one enzyme or step involved), whereas dashed arrows represent most likely several enzymes or steps. Please note that the structures are found in human urine as conjugates with glucuronide, sulfate, and/or methyl groups. Flavan-3-ols are compounds abundant in food products like green tea, red wine, and chocolate. As a result of many people consuming one or more of these food products, the (conjugated) breakdown products of flavan-3-ols are often encountered in human urine. The breakdown is mostly the result of gut microbes that convert the food metabolites through different routes towards small phenolic acids and eventually benzoic acid that readilly forms a conjugate with glycine to result in hippuric acid, a common gut microbial product. A complete list of the conjugates encountered in urine after tea intake can be found with the study of Van der Hooft et al. (2012).The scheme was adapted from Roowi et al.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3685	Vitamin D (calciferol) metabolism		Vitamin D3 (VD3, cholecalciferol) is a steroid hormone that principally plays roles in regulating intestinal calcium absorption and in bone metabolism. It is obtained from the diet and produced in the skin by photolysis of 7-dehydrocholesterol and released into the bloodstream. Very few foods (eg. oily fish, mushrooms exposed to sunlight and cod liver oil) are natural sources of vitamin D.  A small number of countries in the world artificially fortify a few foods with vitamin D. The metabolites of vitamin D are carried in the circulation bound to a plasma protein called vitamin D binding protein (GC) (for review see Delanghe et al. 2015, Chun 2012). Vitamin D undergoes two subsequent hydroxylations to form the active form of the vitamin, 1-alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D). The first hydroxylation takes place in the liver followed by subsequent transport to the kidney where the second hydroxylation takes place. 1,25(OH)2D acts by binding to nuclear vitamin D receptors (Neme et al. 2017) and it has been estimated that upwards of 2000 genes are directly or indirectly regulated which are involved in calcium homeostasis, immune responses, cellular growth, differentiation and apoptosis (Hossein-nezhad et al. 2013, Hossein-nezhad & Holick 2013). Inactivation of 1,25(OH)2D occurs via C23/C24 oxidation catalysed by cytochrome CYP24A1 enzyme (Christakos et al. 2016).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3791	Selenoamino acid metabolism		Selenium (Se) is a trace element essential for the normal function of the body.  Selenoamino acids are defined as those amino acids where selenium has been substituted for sulphur.  Selenium and sulphur share many chemical properties and so the substitution of normal amino acids with selenoamino acids has little effect on protein structure and function.  Both inorganic (selenite, SeO3(2-); and selenate, SeO4(2-)) and organic (selenocysteine, Sec; and selenomethionine, SeMet) forms of selenium can be introduced in the diet where they are transformed into the intermediate selenide (Se(2-)) and then utilized for the <I>de novo</I> synthesis of Sec through a phosphorylated intermediate in a tRNA-dependent fashion. The final step of Sec formation is catalyzed by O-phosphoseryl-tRNA:selenocysteinyl-tRNA synthase (SEPSECS) that converts phosphoseryl-tRNA(Sec) to selenocysteinyl-tRNA(Sec).<br><br>All nutritional selenium is metabolised into selenide directly or through methylselenol (MeSeH).  Sec liberated from selenoproteins is transformed to Se(2-) by selenocysteine lyase (SCLY).  SeMet liberated from general proteins and from free SeMet sources is transformed into Se(2-) either through MeSeH by cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH) followed by demethylation (SeMet to CH3SeH to H2Se), or through Sec by SCLY after the trans-selenation pathway (SeMet to Sec to H2Se). MeSec is hydrolysed into MeSeH by CTH.  Methylseleninic acid (MeSeO2H) is reduced to methylselenol. MeSeH is demethylated to Se(2-) for further utilization for selenoprotein synthesis or oxidised to selenite (SeO3(2-)) for excretion in the form of selenosugar. Additionally, MeSeH is further methylated to dimethylselenide (Me2Se) and trimethylselenonium (Me3Se+) for excretion.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3793	Lysosomal oligosaccharide catabolism		N-Glycosylation is one of the most common co- and posttranslational modifications of eukaryotic proteins occurring in the ER lumen. N-glycosylation plays pivotal roles in protein folding and intra- or inter-cellular trafficking of N-glycosylated proteins. Quality control mechanisms in the ER sift out incorrectly-folded proteins from correctly-folded proteins, the former then destined for degradation. Incorrectly-folded N-glycans are exported to the cytosol where the process of degradation begins. Once the unfolded protein is cleaved from the oligosaccharide (forming free oligosaccharides, fOS), step-wise degradation of mannose moieties, both in the cytosol (Suzuki & Harada 2014) and then in the lysosome (Aronson & Kuranda 1989, Winchester 2005), results in complete degradation. Breakdown must be complete to avoid lysosomal storage diseases that occur when fragments as small as dimers are left undigested.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3795	Striated Muscle Contraction		Striated muscle contraction is a process whereby force is generated within striated muscle tissue, resulting in a change in muscle geometry, or in short, increased force being exerted on the tendons. Force generation involves a chemo-mechanical energy conversion step that is carried out by the actin/myosin complex activity, which generates force through ATP hydrolysis. Striated muscle is a type of muscle composed of myofibrils, containing repeating units called sarcomeres, in which the contractile myofibrils are arranged in parallel to the axis of the cell, resulting in transverse or oblique striations observable at the level of the light microscope.<br>Here striated muscle contraction is represented on the basis of calcium binding to the troponin complex, which exposes the active sites of actin. Once the active sites of actin are exposed, the myosin complex bound to ADP can bind actin and the myosin head can pivot, pulling the thin actin and thick myosin filaments past one another. Once the myosin head pivots, ADP is ejected, a fresh ATP can be bound and the energy from the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP is channeled into kinetic energy by resetting the myosin head. With repeated rounds of this cycle the sarcomere containing the thin and thick filaments effectively shortens, forming the basis of muscle contraction.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3797	Major pathway of rRNA processing in the nucleolus and cytosol		In humans, a 47S precursor rRNA (pre-rRNA) is transcribed by RNA polymerase I from rRNA-encoding genes (rDNA) at the boundary of the fibrillar center and the dense fibrillar components of the nucleolus (Stanek et al. 2001). The 47S precursor is processed over the course of about 5-8 minutes (Popov et al. 2013) by endoribonucleases and exoribonucleases to yield the 28S rRNA and 5.8S rRNA of the 60S subunit and the 18S rRNA of the 40S subunit (reviewed in Mullineus and Lafontaine 2012, Henras et al. 2015). As the pre-rRNA is being transcribed, a large protein complex, the small subunit (SSU) processome, assembles in the region of the 18S rRNA sequence, forming terminal knobs on the pre-rRNA (reviewed in Phipps et al. 2011, inferred from yeast in Dragon et al. 2002). The SSU processome contains both ribosomal proteins of the small subunit and processing factors which process the pre-rRNA and modify nucleotides. Through addition of subunits the SSU processome appears to be converted into the larger 90S pre-ribosome (inferred from yeast in Grandi et al. 2002). An analogous large subunit processome (LSU) assembles in the region of the 28S rRNA, however the LSU is less well characterized (inferred from yeast in McCann et al. 2015).<br>Following cleavage of the pre-rRNA within internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), the pre-ribosomal particle separates into a pre-60S subunit and a pre-40S subunit in the nucleolus (reviewed in Hernandez-Verdun et al. 2010, Phipps et al. 2011). The pre-60S and pre-40S ribosomal particles are then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where the processing factors dissociate and recycle back to the nucleus<br>Nuclease digestions of the 47S pre-rRNA can follow several paths. In the major pathway, the ends of the 47S pre-rRNA are trimmed to yield the 45S pre-rRNA. Digestion at site 2  (also called site 2b in mouse, see Henras et al. 2015 for nomenclature) cleaves the 45S pre-rRNA to yield the 30S pre-rRNA containing the 18S rRNA of the small subunit and the 32S pre-rRNA containing the 5.8S rRNA and the 28S rRNA of the large subunit. The 32S pre-rRNA is digested in the nucleus to yield the 5.8S rRNA and the 28S rRNA while the 30S pre-rRNA is digested in the nucleus to yield the 18SE pre-rRNA which is then processed in the nucleus and cytosol to yield the 18S rRNA. At least 286 human proteins, 74 of which have no yeast homolog, are required for efficient processing of pre-rRNA in the nucleus (Tafforeau et al. 2013) View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=6791226 Reactome].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3798	Regulation of TP53 activity through association with cofactors		Association of TP53 (p53) with various transcriptional co-factors can promote, inhibit or provide specificity towards either transcription of cell cycle arrest genes or transcription of cell death genes. Binding of the zinc finger protein ZNF385A (HZF), which is a transcriptional target of TP53, stimulates transcription of cell cycle arrest genes, such as CDKN1A (Das et al. 2007). Binding of POU4F1 (BRN3A) to TP53 also stimulates transcription of cell cycle arrest genes while inhibiting transcription of pro-apoptotic genes (Budhram-Mahadeo et al. 1999, Hudson et al. 2005).<p>Binding of ASPP family proteins PPP1R13B (ASPP1) or TP53BP2 (ASPP2) to TP53 stimulates transcription of pro-apoptotic TP53 targets (Samuels-Lev et al. 2001, Bergamaschi et al. 2004). Binding of the ASPP family member PPP1R13L (iASSP) inhibits TP53-mediated activation of pro-apoptotic genes probably by interfering with binding of stimulatory ASPPs to TP53 (Bergamaschi et al. 2003). Transcription of pro-apoptotic genes is also stimulated by binding of TP53 to POU4F2 (BRN3B) (Budrham-Mahadeo et al. 2006, Budhram-Mahadeo et al. 2014) or to hCAS/CSE1L (Tanaka et al. 2007).<p>Binding of co-factors to TP53 can also affect protein stability. For example, PHF20 binds to TP53 dimethylated on lysine residues K370 and K382 by unidentified protein lysine methyltransferase(s) and interferes with MDM2 binding, resulting in prolonged TP53 half-life (Cui et al. 2012). Long noncoding RNAs can contribute to p53-dependent transcriptional responses (Huarte et al. 2010). For a general review on this topic, see Espinosa 2008, Beckerman and Prives 2010, Murray-Zmijewski et al. 2008, An et al. 2004 and Barsotti and Prives 2010.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3800	Protein repair		Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H2O2, superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals interact with molecules in the cell causing damage that impairs cellular functions. Although cells have mechanisms to destroy ROS and repair the damage caused by ROS, it is considered to be a major factor in age-related diseases and the ageing process (Zhang & Weissbach 2008, Kim et al. 2014). ROS-scavenging systems include enzymes such as peroxiredoxins, superoxide dismutases, catalases and glutathione peroxidases exist to minimise the potential damage. <br><br>ROS reactions can also cause specific modifications to amino acid side chains that result in structural changes to proteins/enzymes. Methionine (Met) and cysteine (Cys) can be oxidised by ROS to sulfoxide and further oxidised to sulfone derivatives. Both free Met and protein-based Met are readily oxidized to form methionine sulphoxide (MetO) (Brot & Weissbach 1991). Many proteins have been demonstrated to undergo such oxidation and as a consequence have altered function (Levine et al. 2000). Sulphoxide formation can be reversed by the action of the methionine sulphoxide reductase system (MSR) which catalyses the reduction of MetO to Met (Brot et al. 1981). This repair uses one ROS equivalent, so MSR proteins can act as catalytic antioxidants, removing ROS (Levine et al. 1996). Methionine oxidation results in a mixture of methionine (S)-S- and (R)-S-oxides of methionine, diastereomers which are reduced by MSRA and MSRB, respectively. MSRA can reduce both free and protein-based methionine-(S)-S-oxide, whereas MSRB is specific for protein-based methionine-(R)-S-oxide. Mammals typically have only one gene encoding MSRA, but at least three genes encoding MSRBs (Hansel et al. 2005). Although structurally distinct, MRSA and MRSB share a common three-step catalytic mechanism. In the first step, the MSR catalytic cysteine residue interacts with the MetO substrate, which leads to product release and formation of the sulfenic acid. In the second step, an intramolecular disulfide bridge is formed between the catalytic cysteine and the regenerating cysteine. In the final step, the disulfide bridge is reduced by an electron donor, the NADPH-dependent thioredoxin/TR system, leading to the regeneration of the MSR active site (Boschi-Muller et al. 2008).<br><br>Beta-linked isoaspartyl (isoAsp) peptide bonds can arise spontaneously via succinimide-linked deamidation of asparagine (Asn) or dehydration of aspartate (Asp). Protein-L-isoaspartate (D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase (PCMT1, PIMT EC 2.1.1.77) transfers the methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) to the alpha side-chain carboxyl group of L-isoaspartyl and D-aspartatyl amino acids. The resulting methyl ester undergoes spontaneous transformation to L-succinimide, which spontaneously hydrolyses to generates L-aspartyl residues or L-isoaspartyl residues (Knorre et al. 2009). This repair process helps to maintain overall protein integrity. View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=5676934 Reactome].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3801	ERCC6 (CSB) and EHMT2 (G9a) positively regulate rRNA expression		About half of the rRNA genes in the genome are actively expressed, being transcribed by RNA polymerase I (reviewed in Nemeth and Langst 2008, Bartova et al. 2010, Goodfellow and Zomerdijk 2012, Grummt and Langst 2013). As inferred from mouse, those genes that are expressed are activated by ERCC6 (also known as Cockayne Syndrome protein, CSB) which interacts with TTF-I bound to the T0 terminator region (also know as the Sal Box) of rRNA genes (Yuan et al. 2007, reviewed in Birch and Zomerdijk 2008, Grummt and Langst 2013). ERCC6 recruits the histone methyltransferase EHMT2 (also known as G9a) which dimethylates histone H3 at lysine-9 in the coding region of rRNA genes. The dimethylated lysine is bound by CBX3 (also known as Heterochromatic Protein-1gamma, HP1gamma) and increases expression of the rRNA gene. Continuing dimethylation depends on continuing transcription. Mutations in CSB result in dysregulation of RNA polymerase I transcription, which plays a role in the symptoms of Cockayne Syndrome (reviewed in Hannan et al. 2013).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3802	TP53 Regulates Transcription of Cell Death Genes		The tumor suppressor TP53 (p53) exerts its tumor suppressive role in part by regulating transcription of a number of genes involved in cell death, mainly apoptotic cell death. The majority of apoptotic genes that are transcriptional targets of TP53 promote apoptosis, but there are also several TP53 target genes that inhibit apoptosis, providing cells with an opportunity to attempt to repair the damage and/or recover from stress.  <br>Pro-apoptotic transcriptional targets of TP53 involve TRAIL death receptors TNFRSF10A (DR4), TNFRSF10B (DR5), TNFRSF10C (DcR1) and TNFRSF10D (DcR2), as well as the FASL/CD95L death receptor FAS (CD95). TRAIL receptors and FAS induce pro-apoptotic signaling in response to external stimuli via extrinsic apoptosis pathway (Wu et al. 1997, Takimoto et al. 2000, Guan et al. 2001, Liu et al. 2004, Ruiz de Almodovar et al. 2004, Liu et al. 2005, Schilling et al. 2009, Wilson et al. 2013). IGFBP3 is a transcriptional target of TP53 that may serve as a ligand for a novel death receptor TMEM219 (Buckbinder et al. 1995, Ingermann et al. 2010).<p>TP53 regulates expression of a number of genes involved in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, triggered by the cellular stress. Some of TP53 targets, such as BAX, BID, PMAIP1 (NOXA), BBC3 (PUMA) and probably BNIP3L, AIFM2, STEAP3, TRIAP1 and TP53AIP1, regulate the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and/or cytochrome C release (Miyashita and Reed 1995, Oda et al. 2000, Samuels-Lev et al. 2001, Nakano and Vousden 2001, Sax et al. 2002, Passer et al. 2003, Bergamaschi et al. 2004, Li et al. 2004, Fei et al. 2004, Wu et al. 2004, Park and Nakamura 2005, Patel et al. 2008, Wang et al. 2012, Wilson et al. 2013). Other pro-apoptotic genes, either involved in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, extrinsic apoptosis pathway or pyroptosis (inflammation-related cell death), which are transcriptionally regulated by TP53 are cytosolic caspase activators, such as APAF1, PIDD1, and NLRC4, and caspases themselves, such as CASP1, CASP6 and CASP10 (Lin et al. 2000, Robles et al. 2001, Gupta et al. 2001, MacLachlan and El-Deiry 2002, Rikhof et al. 2003, Sadasivam et al. 2005, Brough and Rothwell 2007).<p>It is uncertain how exactly some of the pro-apoptotic TP53 targets, such as TP53I3 (PIG3), RABGGTA, BCL2L14, BCL6, NDRG1 and PERP contribute to apoptosis (Attardi et al. 2000, Guo et al. 2001, Samuels-Lev et al. 2001, Contente et al. 2002, Ihrie et al. 2003, Bergamaschi et al. 2004, Stein et al. 2004, Phan and Dalla-Favera 2004, Jen and Cheung 2005, Margalit et al. 2006, Zhang et al. 2007, Saito et al. 2009, Davies et al. 2009, Giam et al. 2012).<p>TP53 is stabilized in response to cellular stress by phosphorylation on at least serine residues S15 and S20. Since TP53 stabilization precedes the activation of cell death genes, the TP53 tetramer phosphorylated at S15 and S20 is shown as a regulator of pro-apoptotic/pro-cell death genes. Some pro-apoptotic TP53 target genes, such as TP53AIP1, require additional phosphorylation of TP53 at serine residue S46 (Oda et al. 2000, Taira et al. 2007). Phosphorylation of TP53 at S46 is regulated by another TP53 pro-apoptotic target, TP53INP1 (Okamura et al. 2001, Tomasini et al. 2003). Additional post-translational modifications of TP53 may be involved in transcriptional regulation of genes presented in this pathway and this information will be included as evidence becomes available.<p>Activation of some pro-apoptotic TP53 targets, such as BAX, FAS, BBC3 (PUMA) and TP53I3 (PIG3) requires the presence of the complex of TP53 and an ASPP protein, either PPP1R13B (ASPP1) or TP53BP2 (ASPP2) (Samuels-Lev et al. 2001, Bergamaschi et al. 2004, Patel et al. 2008, Wilson et al. 2013), indicating how the interaction with specific co-factors modulates the cellular response/outcome.<p>TP53 family members TP63 and or TP73 can also activate some of the pro-apoptotic TP53 targets, such as FAS, BAX, BBC3 (PUMA), TP53I3 (PIG3), CASP1 and PERP (Bergamaschi et al. 2004, Jain et al. 2005, Ihrie et al. 2005, Patel et al. 2008, Schilling et al. 2009, Celardo et al. 2013).<p> <br>For a review of the role of TP53 in apoptosis and pro-apoptotic transcriptional targets of TP53, please refer to Riley et al. 2008, Murray-Zmijewski et al. 2008, Bieging et al. 2014, Kruiswijk et al. 2015.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3803	Threonine catabolism		The degradation of L-threonine to glycine in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes takes place through a two-step biochemical pathway in mitochondria (Dale 1978). In the first step, L-threonine is oxidised to 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate. This reaction is catalysed by mitochondrial L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase tetramer (TDH tetramer). In the second step, mitochondrial 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate coenzyme A ligase (GCAT, aka KBL) catalyses the reaction between 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate and coenzyme A to form glycine and acetyl-CoA. GCAT resides on the mitochondrial inner membrane in dimeric form and requires pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PXLP) as cofactor. GCAT is thought to exist on the mitochondrial inner membrane in complex with TDH. With these two enzymes located together, it stops the rapid and spontaneous decarboxylation of 2A-3OBU to aminoacetone and carbon dioxide and instead, results in glycine formation (Tressel et al. 1986).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3804	TP53 regulates transcription of cell cycle genes		Under a variety of stress conditions, TP53 (p53), stabilized by stress-induced phosphorylation at least on S15 and S20 serine residues, can induce the transcription of genes involved in cell cycle arrest. Cell cycle arrest provides cells an opportunity to repair the damage before division, thus preventing the transmission of genetic errors to daughter cells. In addition, it allows cells to attempt a recovery from the damage and survive, preventing premature cell death.<p>TP53 controls transcription of genes involved in both G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest. The most prominent TP53 target involved in G1 arrest is the inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases CDKN1A (p21). CDKN1A is one of the earliest genes induced by TP53 (El-Deiry et al. 1993). CDKN1A binds and inactivates CDK2 in complex with cyclin A (CCNA) or E (CCNE), thus preventing G1/S transition (Harper et al. 1993). Nevertheless, under prolonged stress, the cell destiny may be diverted towards an apoptotic outcome. For instance, in case of an irreversible damage, TP53 can induce transcription of an RNA binding protein PCBP4, which can bind and destabilize CDKN1A mRNA, thus alleviating G1 arrest and directing the affected cell towards G2 arrest and, possibly, apoptosis (Zhu and Chen 2000, Scoumanne et al. 2011). Expression of E2F7 is directly induced by TP53. E2F7 contributes to G1 cell cycle arrest by repressing transcription of E2F1, a transcription factor that promotes expression of many genes needed for G1/S transition (Aksoy et al. 2012, Carvajal et al. 2012). ARID3A is a direct transcriptional target of TP53 (Ma et al. 2003) that may promote G1 arrest by cooperating with TP53 in induction of CDKN1A transcription (Lestari et al. 2012). However, ARID3A may also promote G1/S transition by stimulating transcriptional activity of E2F1 (Suzuki et al. 1998, Peeper et al. 2002).<p>TP53 contributes to the establishment of G2 arrest by inducing transcription of GADD45A and SFN, and by inhibiting transcription of CDC25C. TP53 induces GADD45A transcription in cooperation with chromatin modifying enzymes EP300, PRMT1 and CARM1 (An et al. 2004). GADD45A binds Aurora kinase A (AURKA), inhibiting its catalytic activity and preventing AURKA-mediated G2/M transition (Shao et al. 2006, Sanchez et al. 2010). GADD45A also forms a complex with PCNA. PCNA is involved in both normal and repair DNA synthesis. The effect of GADD45 interaction with PCNA, if any, on S phase progression, G2 arrest and DNA repair is not known (Smith et al. 1994, Hall et al. 1995, Sanchez et al. 2010, Kim et al. 2013). SFN (14-3-3-sigma) is induced by TP53 (Hermeking et al. 1997) and contributes to G2 arrest by binding to the complex of CDK1 and CCNB1 (cyclin B1) and preventing its translocation to the nucleus. Phosphorylation of a number of nuclear proteins by the complex of CDK1 and CCNB1 is needed for G2/M transition (Chan et al. 1999). While promoting G2 arrest, SFN can simultaneously inhibit apoptosis by binding to BAX and preventing its translocation to mitochondria, a step involved in cytochrome C release (Samuel et al. 2001). TP53 binds the promoter of the CDC25C gene in cooperation with the transcriptional repressor E2F4 and represses CDC25C transcription, thus maintaining G2 arrest (St Clair et al. 2004, Benson et al. 2014).<p>Several direct transcriptional targets of TP53 are involved in cell cycle arrest but their mechanism of action is still unknown. BTG2 is induced by TP53, leading to cessation of cellular proliferation (Rouault et al. 1996, Duriez et al. 2002). BTG2 binds to the CCR4-NOT complex and promotes mRNA deadenylation activity of this complex. Interaction between BTG2 and CCR4-NOT is needed for the antiproliferative activity of BTG2, but the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated (Rouault et al. 1998, Mauxion et al. 2008, Horiuchi et al. 2009, Doidge et al. 2012, Ezzeddine et al. 2012). Two polo-like kinases, PLK2 and PLK3, are direct transcriptional targets of TP53. TP53-mediated induction of PLK2 may be important for prevention of mitotic catastrophe after spindle damage (Burns et al. 2003). PLK2 is involved in the regulation of centrosome duplication through phosphorylation of centrosome-related proteins CENPJ (Chang et al. 2010) and NPM1 (Krause and Hoffmann 2010). PLK2 is frequently transcriptionally silenced through promoter methylation in B-cell malignancies (Syed et al. 2006). Induction of PLK3 transcription by TP53 (Jen and Cheung 2005) may be important for coordination of M phase events through PLK3-mediated nuclear accumulation of CDC25C (Bahassi et al. 2004). RGCC is induced by TP53 and implicated in cell cycle regulation, possibly through its association with PLK1 (Saigusa et al. 2007). PLAGL1 (ZAC1) is a zinc finger protein directly transcriptionally induced by TP53 (Rozenfeld-Granot et al. 2002). PLAGL1 expression is frequently lost in cancer (Varrault et al. 1998) and PLAGL1 has been implicated in both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Spengler et al. 1997), but its mechanism of action remains unknown.<p>The zinc finger transcription factor ZNF385A (HZF) is a direct transcriptional target of TP53 that can form a complex with TP53 and facilitate TP53-mediated induction of CDKN1A and SFN (14-3-3 sigma) transcription (Das et al. 2007).<p>For a review of the role of TP53 in cell cycle arrest and cell cycle transcriptional targets of TP53, please refer to Riley et al. 2008, Murray-Zmijewski et al. 2008, Bieging et al. 2014, Kruiswijk et al. 2015.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3807	Regulation of TP53 Expression and Degradation		TP53 (p53) tumor suppressor protein is a transcription factor that functions as a homotetramer (Jeffrey et al. 1995). The protein levels of TP53 are low in unstressed cells due to MDM2-mediated ubiquitination that triggers proteasome-mediated degradation of TP53 (Wu et al. 1993). The E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 functions as a homodimer/homo-oligomer or a heterodimer/hetero-oligomer with MDM4 (MDMX) (Linares et al. 2003, Toledo and Wahl 2007, Cheng et al. 2011, Wade et al. 2013).<p>Activating phosphorylation of TP53 at serine residues S15 and S20 in response to genotoxic stress disrupts TP53 interaction with MDM2. In contrast to MDM2, E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF34 (CARP1) and RFFL (CARP2) can ubiquitinate phosphorylated TP53 (Yang et al. 2007). Binding of MDM2 to TP53 is also inhibited by the tumor suppressor p14-ARF, transcribed from the CDKN2A gene in response to oncogenic signaling or oxidative stress (Zhang et al. 1998, Parisi et al. 2002, Voncken et al. 2005). Ubiquitin-dependant degradation of TP53 can also be promoted by PIRH2 (Leng et al. 2003) and COP1 (Dornan et al. 2004) ubiquitin ligases. HAUSP (USP7) can deubiquitinate TP53, contributing to TP53 stabilization (Li et al. 2002).<p>While post-translational regulation plays a prominent role, TP53 activity is also controlled at the level of promoter function (reviewed in Saldana-Meyer and Recillas-Targa 2011), mRNA stability and translation efficiency (Mahmoudi et al. 2009, Le et al. 2009, Takagi et al. 2005).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3808	TP53 Regulates Transcription of DNA Repair Genes		Several DNA repair genes contain p53 response elements and their transcription is positively regulated by TP53 (p53). TP53-mediated regulation probably ensures increased protein level of DNA repair genes under genotoxic stress.<p>TP53 directly stimulates transcription of several genes involved in DNA mismatch repair, including MSH2 (Scherer et al. 2000, Warnick et al. 2001), PMS2 and MLH1 (Chen and Sadowski 2005). TP53 also directly stimulates transcription of DDB2, involved in nucleotide excision repair (Tan and Chu 2002), and FANCC, involved in the Fanconi anemia pathway that repairs DNA interstrand crosslinks (Liebetrau et al. 1997). Other p53 targets that can influence DNA repair functions are RRM2B (Kuo et al. 2012), XPC (Fitch et al. 2003), GADD45A (Amundson et al. 2002), CDKN1A (Cazzalini et al. 2010) and PCNA (Xu and Morris 1999). Interestingly, the responsiveness of some of these DNA repair genes to p53 activation has been shown in human cells but not for orthologous mouse genes (Jegga et al. 2008, Tan and Chu 2002). Contrary to the positive modulation of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and mismatch repair (MMR), p53 can negatively modulate base excision repair (BER), by down-regulating the endonuclease APEX1 (APE1), acting in concert with SP1 (Poletto et al. 2016).<p>Expression of several DNA repair genes is under indirect TP53 control, through TP53-mediated stimulation of cyclin K (CCNK) expression (Mori et al. 2002). CCNK is the activating cyclin for CDK12 and CDK13 (Blazek et al. 2013). The complex of CCNK and CDK12 binds and phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase II subunit POLR2A, which is necessary for efficient transcription of long DNA repair genes, including BRCA1, ATR, FANCD2, FANCI, ATM, MDC1, CHEK1 and RAD51D. Genes whose transcription is regulated by the complex of CCNK and CDK12 are mainly involved in the repair of DNA double strand breaks and/or the Fanconi anemia pathway (Blazek et al. 2011, Cheng et al. 2012, Bosken et al. 2014, Bartkowiak and Greenleaf 2015, Ekumi et al. 2015).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3809	tRNA processing in the mitochondrion		Each strand of the circular mitochondrial genome is transcribed to yield long polycistronic transcripts, the heavy strand transcript and the light strand transcript, which are then cleaved to yield tRNAs, rRNAs, and mRNAs (Mercer et al. 2011, reviewed in Suzuki et al. 2011, Rossmanith 2012, Powell et al. 2015). Mitochondrial RNase P, which is completely distinct from nuclear RNase P in having different protein subunits and no RNA component, cleaves at the 5' ends of tRNAs. RNase Z, an isoform of ELAC2 in mitochondria, cleaves at the 3' ends of tRNAs. (A different isoform of ELAC2 serves as RNase Z in the nucleus.) Unknown nucleases make additional cleavages near the 5' end of MT-CO3, the 5' end of CO1, the 5' end of CYB, and the 3' end of ND6. TRNT1 (CCA-adding enzyme) then post-transcriptionally polymerizes the universal acceptor sequence CCA onto the 3' ends of the cleaved tRNAs. In yeast, plants, and protozoa additional tRNAs encoded in the nucleus are imported into mitochondria from the cytosol (reviewed in Schneider 2011), however human mitochondria encode a complete complement of 22 tRNAs required for translation and tRNA import has not been observed in mammals. Mutations that affect mitochondrial tRNA processing cause human diseases that are generally characterized by abnormalities in energy-requiring tissues such as brain and muscle (reviewed in Suzuki et al. 2011, Sarin and Leidel 2014).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3810	Cardiac conduction		"The normal sequence of contraction of atria and ventricles of the heart require activation of groups of cardiac cells. The mechanism must elicit rapid changes in heart rate and respond to changes in autonomic tone. The cardiac action potential controls these functions. Action potentials are generated by the movement of ions through transmembrane ion channels in cardiac cells. Like skeletal myocytes (and axons), in the resting state, a given cardiac myocyte has a negative membrane potential. In both muscle types, after a delay (the absolute refractory period), K+ channels reopen and the resulting flow of K+ out of the cell causes repolarisation. The voltage-gated Ca2+ channels on the cardiac sarcolemma membrane are generally triggered by an influx of Na+ during phase 0 of the action potential. Cardiac muscle cells are so tightly bound that when one of these cells is excited the action potential spreads to all of them. The standard model used to understand the cardiac action potential is the action potential of the ventricular myocyte (Park & Fishman 2011, Grant 2009).<br><br>The action potential has 5 phases (numbered 0-4). Phase 4 describes the membrane potential when a cell is not being stimulated. The normal resting potential in the ventricular myocardium is between -85 to -95 mV. The K+ gradient across the cell membrane is the key determinant in the normal resting potential. Phase 0 is the rapid depolarisation phase in which electrical stimulation of a cell opens the closed, fast Na+ channels, causing a large influx of Na+ creating a Na+ current (I<sub>Na+</sub>). This causes depolarisation of the cell. The slope of phase 0 represents the maximum rate of potential change and differs in contractile and pacemaker cells. Phase 1 is the inactivation of the fast Na+ channels. The transient net outward current causing the small downward deflection (the ""notch"" of the action potetial) is due to the movement of K+ and Cl- ions. In pacemaker cells, this phase is due to rapid K+ efflux and closure of L-type Ca2+ channels. Phase 2 is the plateau phase which is sustained by a balance of Ca2+ influx and K+ efflux. This phase sustains muscle contraction. Phase 3 of the action potential is where a concerted action of two outward delayed currents brings about repolarisation back down to the resting potential (Bartos et al. 2015).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3811	Smooth Muscle Contraction		Layers of smooth muscle cells can be found in the walls of numerous organs and tissues within the body. Smooth muscle tissue lacks the striated banding pattern characteristic of skeletal and cardiac muscle. Smooth muscle is triggered to contract by the autonomic nervous system, hormones, autocrine/paracrine agents, local chemical signals, and changes in load or length.<br>Actin:myosin cross bridging is used to develop force with the influx of calcium ions (Ca2+) initiating contraction. Two separate protein pathways, both triggered by calcium influx contribute to contraction, a calmodulin driven kinase pathway, and a caldesmon driven pathway.<br>Recent evidence suggests that actin, myosin, and intermediate filaments may be far more volatile then previously suspected, and that changes in these cytoskeletal elements along with alterations of the focal adhesions that anchor these proteins may contribute to the contractile cycle.<br>Contraction in smooth muscle generally uses a variant of the same sliding filament model found in striated muscle, except in smooth muscle the actin and myosin filaments are anchored to focal adhesions, and dense bodies, spread over the surface of the smooth muscle cell. When actin and myosin move across one another focal adhesions are drawn towards dense bodies, effectively squeezing the cell into a smaller conformation. The sliding is triggered by calcium:caldesmon binding, caldesmon acting in an analogous fashion to troponin in striated muscle.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3812	SALM protein interactions at the synapse		Recruitment of receptors and ion channels to the postsynaptic membrane is the last step in synapse formation. Many of these proteins interact directly or indirectly with postsynaptic density-95 (PSD95)/Discs large/zona occludens-1 (PDZ) proteins, thus linking them to the postsynaptic scaffold and providing a mechanism for both retaining the protein at the synapse and keeping its proximity to signaling molecules known to associate with PDZ proteins (Nourry et al. 2003, Kim & Sheng 2004, Montgomery et al. 2004, Sheng and Kim 2011). The synaptic adhesion-like molecules (SALM) family belongs to the superfamily of leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing adhesion molecules, alternatively referred as LRFN (leucine-rich repeat and fibronectin III domain-containing) is an synapse adhesion molecule linked to NMDA and AMPA receptors. It includes five known members (SALMs 1-5 or LRFN1-5), which have been implicated in the regulation of neurite outgrowth and branching, and synapse formation and maturation. SLAM proteins are distributed to both dendrites and axons in neurons (Ko et al. 2006, Wang et al. 2006, Morimura et al. 2006, Nam ett al. 2011). The family members, SALM1-SALM5, have a single transmembrane (TM) domain and contain extracellular leucine-rich repeats, an Ig C2 type domain, a fibronectin type III domain, and an intracellular postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95)/Discs large/zona occludens-1 (PDZ) binding domain, which is present on all members except SALM4 and SALM5.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3813	Activation of anterior HOX genes in hindbrain development during early embryogenesis		In mammals, anterior Hox genes may be defined as paralog groups 1 to 4 (Natale et al. 2011), which are involved in development of the hindbrain through sequential expression in the rhombomeres, transient segments of the neural tube that form during development of the hindbrain (reviewed in Alexander et al. 2009, Soshnikova and Duboule 2009, Tumpel et al. 2009, Mallo et al. 2010, Andrey and Duboule 2014). Hox gene activation during mammalian development has been most thoroughly studied in mouse embryos and the results have been extended to human development by in vitro experiments with human embryonal carcinoma cells and human embryonic stem cells.<br>Expression of a typical anterior Hox gene has an anterior boundary located at the junction between two rhombomeres and continues caudally to regulate segmentation and segmental fate in ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Anterior boundaries of expression of successive Hox paralog groups are generally separated from each other by 2 rhombomeres. For example, HOXB2 is expressed in rhombomere 3 (r3) and caudally while HOXB3 is expressed in r5 and caudally. Exceptions exist, however, as HOXA1, HOXA2, and HOXB1 do not follow the rule and HOXD1 and HOXC4 are not expressed in rhombomeres. Hox genes within a Hox cluster are expressed colinearly: the gene at the 3' end of the cluster is expressed earliest, and hence most anteriorly, then genes 5' are activated sequentially in the same order as they occur in the cluster. <br>Activation of expression occurs epigenetically by loss of polycomb repressive complexes and change of bivalent chromatin to active chromatin through, in part, the actions of trithorax family proteins (reviewed in Soshnikova and Duboule 2009). Hox gene expression initiates in the posterior primitive streak that will contribute to extraembryonic mesoderm. Expression then extends anteriorly into the cells that will become the embryo, where expression is first observed in presumptive lateral plate mesoderm and is transmitted to both paraxial mesoderm and neurectoderm formed by gastrulation along the primitive streak (reviewed in Deschamps et al. 1999, Casaca et al. 2014).<br>Prior to establishment of the rhombomeres, expression of HOXA1 and HOXB1 is initiated near the future site of r3 and caudally by a gradient of retinoic acid (RA). (Mechanisms of retinoic acid signaling are reviewed in Cunningham and Duester 2015.) The RA is generated by the ALDH1A2 (RALDH2) enzyme located in somites flanking the caudal hindbrain and degraded by CYP26 enzymes expressed initially in anterior neural ectoderm of the early gastrula and then throughout most of the hindbrain (reviewed in White and Schilling 2008). HOXA1 with PBX1,2 and MEIS2 directly activate transcription of ALDH1A2 to maintain retinoic acid synthesis in the somitic mesoderm (Vitobello et al. 2011). Differentiation of embryonal carcinoma cells and embryonic stem cells in response to retinoic acid is used to model the process of differentiation in vitro (reviewed in Soprano et al. 2007, Gudas et al. 2013).<br>HOXA1 appears to set the anterior limit of HOXB1 expression (Barrow et al. 2000). HOXB1 initiates expression of EGR2 (KROX20) in presumptive r3. EGR2 then activates HOXA2 expression in r3 and r5 while HOXB1, together with PBX1 and MEIS:PKNOX1 (MEIS:PREP), activates expression of HOXA2 in r4 and caudal rhombomeres.  AP-2 transcription factors maintain expression of HOXA2 in neural crest cells (Maconochie et al. 1999). HOXB1 also activates expression of HOXB2 in r3 and caudal rhombomeres. EGR2 negatively regulates HOXB1 so that by the time rhombomeres appear, HOXB1 is restricted to r4 and HOXA1 is no longer detectable (Barrow et al. 2000). EGR2 and MAFB (Kreisler) then activate HOXA3 and HOXB3 in r5 and caudal rhombomeres. Retinoic acid activates HOXA4, HOXB4, and HOXD4 in r7, the final rhombomere. HOX proteins, in turn, activate expression of genes in combination with other factors, notably members of the TALE family of transcription factors (PBX, PREP, and MEIS, reviewed in Schulte and Frank 2014, Rezsohazy et al. 2015). HOX proteins also participate in non-transcriptional interactions (reviewed in Rezsohazy 2014). In zebrafish, Xenopus, and chicken factors such as Meis3, Fgf3, Fgf8, and vHNF regulate anterior hox genes (reviewed in Schulte and Frank 2014), however less is known about the roles of homologous factors in mammals.<br> Mutations in HOXA1 in humans have been observed to cause developmental abnormalities located mostly in the head and neck region (Tischfield et al. 2005, Bosley et al. 2008). A missense mutation in HOXA2 causes microtia, hearing impairment, and partially cleft palate (Alasti et al. 2008). A missense mutation in HOXB1 causes a similar phenotype to the Hoxb1 null mutation in mice: bilateral facial palsy, hearing loss, and strabismus (improper alignment of the eyes) (Webb et al. 2012).

Mammals contain 4 general metallothionein isoforms (MT1,2,3,4). The MT1 isoform has radiated in primates to 8 or 9 functional proteins (depending on classification of MT1L). Each mammalian metallothionein binds a total of 7 divalent metal ions in two clusters, the alpha and beta clusters. Though the functions of metallothioneins have not been fully elucidated, they appear to participate in detoxifying heavy metals (reviewed in Sharma et al. 2013), storing and transporting zinc, and redox biochemistry.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3816	Regulation of TP53 Activity through Acetylation		Transcriptional activity of TP53 is positively regulated by acetylation of several of its lysine residues. BRD7 binds TP53 and promotes acetylation of TP53 lysine residue K382 by acetyltransferase EP300 (p300). Acetylation of K382 enhances TP53 binding to target promoters, including CDKN1A (p21), MDM2, SERPINE1, TIGAR, TNFRSF10C and NDRG1 (Bensaad et al. 2010, Burrows et al. 2010. Drost et al. 2010). The histone acetyltransferase KAT6A, in the presence of PML, also acetylates TP53 at K382, and, in addition, acetylates K120 of TP53. KAT6A-mediated acetylation increases transcriptional activation of CDKN1A by TP53 (Rokudai et al. 2013). Acetylation of K382 can be reversed by the action of the NuRD complex, containing the TP53-binding MTA2 subunit, resulting in inhibition of TP53 transcriptional activity (Luo et al. 2000). Acetylation of lysine K120 in the DNA binding domain of TP53 by the MYST family acetyltransferases KAT8 (hMOF) and KAT5 (TIP60) can modulate the decision between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Sykes et al. 2006, Tang et al. 2006). Studies with acetylation-defective knock-in mutant mice indicate that lysine acetylation in the p53 DNA binding domain acts in part by uncoupling transactivation and transrepression of gene targets, while retaining ability to modulate energy metabolism and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and influencing ferroptosis (Li et al. 2012, Jiang et al. 2015).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3817	Interleukin-20 family signaling		The interleukin 20 (IL20) subfamily comprises IL19, IL20, IL22, IL24 and IL26. They are members of the larger IL10 family, but have been grouped together based on their usage of common receptor subunits and similarities in their target cell profiles and biological functions. Members of the IL20 subfamily facilitate the communication between leukocytes and epithelial cells, thereby enhancing innate defence mechanisms and tissue repair processes at epithelial surfaces. Much of the understanding of this group of cytokines is based on IL22, which is the most studied member (Rutz et al. 2014, Akdis M et al. 2016, Longsdon et al. 2012).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3818	Signaling by MST1		Inflammatory mediators such as growth factors produced by macrophages play an important role in the inflammatory response occurring during bacterial infection, tissue injury and immune responses. Many growth factors and their receptor-type protein tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play a critical role in inflammation, wound healing and tissue remodelling. The growth factor hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (MST1, also known as macrophage-stimulating protein, MSP) binds to a specific receptor, macrophage-stimulating protein receptor (MST1R, also known as RON, recepteur d'origine nantais). MST1 belongs to the kringle protein family, which includes HGF and plasminogen. It is produced by the liver and circulates in the blood as a biologically-inactive single chain precursor (pro-MST1). Proteolytic cleavage of pro-MST1 into the biologically-active MST1 dimer is necessary for receptor binding. Cleavage occurs during blood coagulation and at inflammatory sites, the resultant MST1 dimer then binds MST1R receptors on local macrophages. MST1R is ubiquitously expressed but mainly in epithelial cells.<br><br>MST1 binding to MST1R promotes receptor homodimerisation which in turn allows autophosphorylation of two tyrosine residues within the catalytic site which regulates kinase activity and allows phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal binding site of the receptor. The docking site is essential for downstream signaling through direct and indirect binding of SH2 domain-containing adaptor proteins such as GRB2, PI3K, and SRC. MST1/MST1R signaling plays a dual role in regulating inflammation; initially stimulating chemotaxis and phagocytosis (macrophage activation) and then exerts broad inhibitory effects on macrophages, limiting the extent of inflammtory responses (Wang et al. 2002). MST1R is upregulated in many epithelial cancers where it is thought to play a role in the progression of these types of cancer (Kretschmann et al. 2010).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP382	MAPK signaling pathway		The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a highly conserved module that is involved in various cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. Mammals express at least four distinctly regulated groups of MAPKs, extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK)-1/2, Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK1/2/3), p38 proteins (p38alpha/beta/gamma/delta) and ERK5, that are activated by specific MAPKKs: MEK1/2 for ERK1/2, MKK3/6 for the p38, MKK4/7 (JNKK1/2) for the JNKs, and MEK5 for ERK5. Each MAPKK, however, can be activated by more than one MAPKKK, increasing the complexity and diversity of MAPK signalling. Presumably each MAPKKK confers responsiveness to distinct stimuli. For example, activation of ERK1/2 by growth factors depends on the MAPKKK c-Raf, but other MAPKKKs may activate ERK1/2 in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli.Description reference: KEGG http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway:map04010Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP382 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606

It plays a pivotal role in host defenses in response to microbial infection and is involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and allergic syndromes. IL17 activates several downstream signaling pathways including NFkB, MAPKs and C/EBPs, inducing the expression of antibacterial peptides, proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). IL17 can stabilize the mRNA of genes induced by TNF-alpha.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3822	Metabolism of vitamin K		Vitamin K is a required co-factor in a single metabolic reaction, the gamma-carboxylation of glutamate residues of proteins catalyzed by GGCX (gamma-carboxyglutamyl carboxylase). Substrates of GGCX include blood clotting factors, osteocalcin (OCN), and growth arrest-specific protein 6 (GAS6) (Brenner et al. 1998). Vitamin K is derived from green leafy vegetables as phylloquinone and is synthesized by gut flora as menaquinone-7. These molecules are taken up by intestinal enterocytes with other lipids, packaged into chylomicrons, and delivered via the lymphatic and blood circulation to tissues of the body, notably hepatocytes and osteoblasts, via processes of lipoprotein trafficking (Shearer & Newman 2014; Shearer et al. 2012) described elsewhere in Reactome.<P>In these tissues, menadiol (reduced vitamin K3) reacts with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to form MK4 (vitamin K hydroquinone), the form of the vitamin required as cofactor for gamma-carboxylation of protein glutamate residues (Hirota et al. 2013). The gamma-carboxylation reactions, annotated elsewhere in Reactome as a part of protein metabolism, convert MK4 to its epoxide form, which is inactive as a cofactor. Two related enzymes, VKORC1 and VKORCL1, can each catalyze the reduction of MK4 epoxide to active MK4. VKORC1 activity is essential for normal operation of the blood clotting cascade and for osteocalcin function (Ferron et al. 2015). A physiological function for VKORCL1 has not yet been definitively established (Hammed et al. 2013; Tie et al. 2014).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3823	Regulation of TP53 Activity through Methylation		TP53 (p53) undergoes methylation on several lysine and arginine residues, which modulates its transcriptional activity.<p>PRMT5, recruited to TP53 as part of the ATM-activated complex that includes TTC5, JMY and EP300 (p300), methylates TP53 arginine residues R333, R335 and R337. PRMT5-mediated methylation promotes TP53-stimulated expression of cell cycle arrest genes (Shikama et al. 1999, Demonacos et al. 2001, Demonacos et al. 2004, Adams et al. 2008, Adams et al. 2012). SETD9 (SET9) methylates TP53 at lysine residue K372, resulting in increased stability and activity of TP53 (Chuikov et al. 2004, Couture et al. 2006, Bai et al. 2011).<p>TP53 transcriptional activity is repressed by SMYD2-mediated methylation of TP53 at lysine residue K370 (Huang et al. 2006). Dimethylation of TP53 at lysine residue K373 by the complex of methyltransferases EHMT1 and EHMT2 also represses TP53-mediated transcription (Huang et al. 2010). The chromatin compaction factor L3MBTL1 binds TP53 monomethylated at lysine K382 by SETD8 (SET8) and, probably through changing local chromatin architecture, represses transcription of TP53 targets (West et al. 2010). The histone lysine-specific demethylase LSD1 interacts with TP53 and represses p53-mediated transcriptional activation (Huang et al. 2007). PRMT1 and CARM1 can also modulate p53 functions in a cooperative manner (An et al. 2004).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=6804760 Reactome].		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3827	RNA polymerase II transcribes snRNA genes		Small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) play key roles in splicing and some of them, specifically the U1 and U2 snRNAs, are encoded by multicopy snRNA gene clusters containing tandem arrays of genes, about 30 in the RNU1 cluster (Bernstein et al. 1985) and about 10-20 in the RNU2 cluster (Van Ardsell and Weiner 1984). Whereas U6 snRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase III, U1,U2, U4, U4atac, U5, U11, and U12 genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Transcription of the U1 and U2 genes has been most extensively studied and the other snRNA genes as well as other genes with similar promoter structures, for example the SNORD13 gene, are inferred to be transcribed by similar reactions. The snRNA genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II are distinguished from mRNA-encoding genes by the presence of a proximal sequence element (PSE) rather than a TATA box and the presence of the Integrator complex rather than the Mediator complex (reviewed in Egloff et al. 2008, Jawdeker and Henry 2008).<br>The snRNA genes are among the most rapidly transcribed genes in the genome. The 5' transcribed region of the U2 snRNA gene is largely single-stranded during interphase and metaphase (Pavelitz et al. 2008) and chromatin within the transcribed region is cleared of nucleosomes (O'Reilly et al. 2014). Transcriptional activation of the RNA polymerase II transcribed snRNA genes begins with binding of transcription factors to the distal sequence element (DSE) of the promoter (reviewed in Hernandez 2001, Egloff et al. 2008, Jawdeker and Henry 2008). The factors, which include POU2F1 (Oct-1), POU2F2 (Oct-2), ZNF143 (Staf) and Sp1, promote binding of the SNAPc complex (also known as PTF and PBP) to the PSE. SNAPc helps clear the gene of nucleosomes (O'Reilly et al. 2014) and recruits initiation factors (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and snTAFc:TBP) which recruit RNA polymerase II. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (reviewed in Egloff and Murphy 2008) by CDK7 recruits RPAP2 and the Integrator complex, which is required for later processing of the 3' end of the pre-snRNA transcript (reviewed in Chen and Wagner 2010, Baillat and Wagner 2015). The Little Elongation Complex (LEC) also appears to bind around the time of transcription initiation (Hu et al. 2013). As transcription proceeds, RPAP2 dephosphorylates serine-5 and P-TEFb phosphorylates serine-2 of the CTD. As transcription reaches the end of the snRNA gene serine-7 of the CTD is phosphorylated. These marks serve to bind protein complexes and are required for 3' processing of the pre-snRNA (reviewed in Egloff and Murphy 2008). After transcription proceeds through the conserved 3' processing sequence of the pre-snRNA the Integrator complex cleaves the pre-snRNA. Transcription then terminates downstream in a less well characterized reaction that requires elements of the polyadenylation system.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3828	rRNA modification in the nucleus and cytosol		Human ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) contain about 200 residues that are enzymatically modified after transcription in the nucleolus (Maden and Khan 1977, Maden 1988, Maden and Hughes 1997, reviewed in Hernandez-Verdun et al. 2010, Boschi-Muller and Motorin 2013). The modified residues occur in regions of the rRNAs that are located in functionally important parts of the ribosome, notably in the A and P peptidyl transfer sites, the polypeptide exit tunnel, and intersubunit contacts (Polikanov et al. 2015, reviewed in Decatur and Fournier 2002, Chow et al. 2007, Sharma and Lafontaine 2015). The two most common modifications are pseudouridines and 2'-O-methylribonucleotides. Formation of pseudouridine from encoded uridine is catalyzed by box H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complexes (reviewed in Hamma and Ferre-D'Amare 2010, Watkins and Bohnsack 2011, Ge and Yu 2013, Kierzek et al. 2014, Yu and Meier 2014) and methylation of the hydroxyl group of the 2' carbon is catalyzed by box C/D snoRNPs (Kiss-Laszlo et al. 1996, Lapinaite et al. 2013, reviewed in Watkins and Bohnsack 2011). The snoRNP complexes contain common sets of protein subunits and unique snoRNAs that guide each complex to its target nucleotide of the rRNA by base-pairing between the snoRNA and the rRNA (reviewed in Henras et al. 2004, Watkins and Bohnsack 2011). Other modifications of rRNA include 5-methylcytidine (reviewed in Squires and Preiss 2010), 1-methylpseudouridine, 7-methylguanosine, 6-dimethyladenosine, and 4-acetylcytidine (reviewed in Sharma and Lafontaine 2015). In yeast most modifications are introduced co-transcriptionally (Kos and Tollervey 2010, reviewed in Turowski and Tollervey 2015), however the order of modification events and pre-rRNA cleavage events is not well characterized.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3829	rRNA processing		Each eukaryotic cytosolic ribosome contains 4 molecules of RNA: 28S rRNA (25S rRNA in yeast), 5.8S rRNA, and 5S rRNA in the 60S subunit and 18S rRNA in the 40S subunit. The 18S rRNA, 5.8S rRNA, and 28S rRNA are produced by endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic processing of a single 47S precursor (pre-rRNA) (reviewed in Henras et al. 2015). Transcription of ribosomal RNA genes, processing of pre-rRNA, and assembly of precursor 60S and 40S subunits occur in the nucleolus (reviewed in Hernandez-Verdun et al. 2010), with a few late reactions occurring in the cytosol. Within the nucleolus non-transcribed DNA and inactive polymerase complexes are located in the fibrillar center, active DNA polymerase I transcription occurs at the interface between the fibrillar center and the dense fibrillar component, early processing of pre-rRNA occurs in the dense fibrillar component, and late processing of pre-rRNA occurs in the granular component (Stanek et al. 2001). <br>Processed ribosomal RNA contains many modified nucleotides which are generated by enzymes acting on encoded nucleotides contained in the precursor rRNA (reviewed in Boschi-Muller and Motorin 2013). The most numerous modifications are pseudouridine residues and 2'-O-methylribonucleotides. Pseudouridylation is guided by base pairing between the precursor rRNA and a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) in a Box C/D snoRNP (reviewed in Henras et al 2004, Yu and Meier 2014).  Similarly, 2'-O-methylation is guided by base pairing between the precursor rRNA and a snoRNA in a Box H/ACA snoRNP (reviewed in Henras et al. 2004, Hamma and Ferre-D'Amare 2010). Other modifications include N(1)-methylpseudouridine, 5-methylcytosine, 7-methylguanosine, 6-dimethyladenosine, and 4-acetylcytidine. Modification of nucleotides occur as the pre-rRNA is being cleaved. However, the order of cleavage and modification steps is not clear so these two processes are presented separately here. Defects in ribosome biogenesis factors can cause disease (reviewed in Freed et al. 2010).<br>Mitochondrial ribosomes are completely distinct from cytoplasmic ribosomes, having different protein subunits and 12S rRNA and 16S rRNA.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3838	Regulation of TP53 Activity through Phosphorylation		Phosphorylation of TP53 (p53) at the N-terminal serine residues S15 and S20 plays a critical role in protein stabilization as phosphorylation at these sites interferes with binding of the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 to TP53. Several different kinases can phosphorylate TP53 at S15 and S20. In response to double strand DNA breaks, S15 is phosphorylated by ATM (Banin et al. 1998, Canman et al. 1998, Khanna et al. 1998), and S20 by CHEK2 (Chehab et al. 1999, Chehab et al. 2000, Hirao et al. 2000). DNA damage or other types of genotoxic stress, such as stalled replication forks, can trigger ATR-mediated phosphorylation of TP53 at S15 (Lakin et al. 1999, Tibbetts et al. 1999) and CHEK1-mediated phosphorylation of TP53 at S20 (Shieh et al. 2000). In response to various types of cell stress, NUAK1 (Hou et al. 2011), CDK5 (Zhang et al. 2002, Lee et al. 2007, Lee et al. 2008), AMPK (Jones et al. 2005) and TP53RK (Abe et al. 2001, Facchin et al. 2003) can phosphorylate TP53 at S15, while PLK3 (Xie, Wang et al. 2001, Xie, Wu et al. 2001) can phosphorylate TP53 at S20.<p>Phosphorylation of TP53 at serine residue S46 promotes transcription of TP53-regulated apoptotic genes rather than cell cycle arrest genes. Several kinases can phosphorylate S46 of TP53, including ATM-activated DYRK2, which, like TP53, is targeted for degradation by MDM2 (Taira et al. 2007, Taira et al. 2010). TP53 is also phosphorylated at S46 by HIPK2 in the presence of the TP53 transcriptional target TP53INP1 (D'Orazi et al. 2002, Hofmann et al. 2002, Tomasini et al. 2003). CDK5, in addition to phosphorylating TP53 at S15, also phosphorylates it at S33 and S46, which promotes neuronal cell death (Lee et al. 2007).<p>MAPKAPK5 (PRAK) phosphorylates TP53 at serine residue S37, promoting cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence in response to oncogenic RAS signaling (Sun et al. 2007).<p>NUAK1 phosphorylates TP53 at S15 and S392, and phosphorylation at S392 may contribute to TP53-mediated transcriptional activation of cell cycle arrest genes (Hou et al. 2011). S392 of TP53 is also phosphorylated by the complex of casein kinase II (CK2) bound to the FACT complex, enhancing transcriptional activity of TP53 in response to UV irradiation (Keller et al. 2001, Keller and Lu 2002).<p>The activity of TP53 is inhibited by phosphorylation at serine residue S315, which enhances MDM2 binding and degradation of TP53. S315 of TP53 is phosphorylated by Aurora kinase A (AURKA) (Katayama et al. 2004) and CDK2 (Luciani et al. 2000). Interaction with MDM2 and the consequent TP53 degradation is also increased by phosphorylation of TP53 threonine residue T55 by the transcription initiation factor complex TFIID (Li et al. 2004).<p>Aurora kinase B (AURKB) has been shown to phosphorylate TP53 at serine residue S269 and threonine residue T284, which is possibly facilitated by the binding of the NIR co-repressor. AURKB-mediated phosphorylation was reported to inhibit TP53 transcriptional activity through an unknown mechanism (Wu et al. 2011). A putative direct interaction between TP53 and AURKB has also been described and linked to TP53 phosphorylation and S183, T211 and S215 and TP53 degradation (Gully et al. 2012).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3842	Intra-Golgi and retrograde Golgi-to-ER traffic		The mammalian Golgi complex, a central hub of both anterograde and retrograde trafficking, is a ribbon of stacked cisterna with biochemically distinct compartments (reviewed in Glick and Nakano, 2009; Szul and Sztul, 2011). Anterograde cargo from the ERGIC and ER is received at the cis-Golgi, trafficked through the medial- and trans-Golgi and released through the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the endolysosomal system and the plasma membrane. Although still under debate, current models of Golgi trafficking favour the cisternal maturation model, where anterograde cargo remain associated with their original lipid membrane during transit through the Golgi and are exposed to sequential waves of processing enzymes by the retrograde movement of Golgi resident proteins. In this way, cis-cisterna mature to medial- and trans-cisterna as the early acting Golgi enzymes are replaced by later acting ones (reviewed in Pelham, 2001; Storrie, 2005; Glick and Nakano, 2009; Szul and Sztul, 2011).  More recently. a kiss-and-run (KAR) model for intra-Golgi trafficking has been proposed, which marries aspects of the cisternal maturation model with a diffusion model of transport (reviewed in Mironov et al, 2103).<br>Like the anterograde ERGIC-to Golgi transport step,  intra-Golgi trafficking between the cisterna appears to be COPI-dependent (Storrie and Nilsson, 2002; Szul and Sztul, 2011). Numerous snares and tethering complexes contribute to the targeting and fusion events that are required to maintain the specificity and directionality of these trafficking events (reviewed in Chia and Gleeson, 2014).  Golgi tethers include long coiled coiled proteins like the Golgins, as well as multisubunit tethers like the COG complex.  These tethers make numerous interactions with other components of the secretory system including RABs, SNAREs, motor and coat proteins as well as components of the cytoskeleton (reviewed in Munro, 2011; Willet et al, 2013). <br>Retrograde traffic from the cis-Golgi back to the ERGIC and ER depends on both the COPI-dependent pathway, which  appears to be important for recyling of KDEL receptors, and a more recently described COPI-independent pathway that relies on RAB6 (reviewed in Szul and Sztul, 2011; Heffernan and Simpson, 2014). RAB6 and RAB9 also play roles at the TGN side of the Golgi, where they are implicated in the docking of vesicles derived from the endolysosomal system and the plasma membrane (reviewed in Pfeffer, 2011) View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=6811442 Reactome].		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3845	Canonical and non-canonical Notch signaling		"This pathway is based on figure 1 of ""Alteration of Notch signaling in skeletal development and disease"" (see bibliography). In the NOTCH signaling pathway, mammals have 11 ligands (JAG, DLL, DLK, etc.) and 4 NOTCH receptors (NOTCH1,2,3,4). The pathway is activated by the interaction between a ligand in a ligand expressing cell and a NOTCH receptor in an adjacent, receptor expressing cell.  At this point, proteases (ADAM10 and PSEN1/2) cleave the intracellular domain (NICD) of the NOTCH protein from the extracellular domain (NECD). In the canonical pathway, NICD travels into the nucleus where it forms a transcription complex with other proteins (RBPJ and MAML1,2,3). This transcriptional complex regulates the transcription of downstream canonical target genes, such as HES1 and HEY1. In the non-canonical pathway, otherwise known as RBPJ-independent NOTCH signaling, NOTCH can activate through R-Ras to promote cell adhesion. Alternatively, NOTCH may interact with IKKa in the NF-kB pathway, or LEF1 in the Wnt pathway.While the role that the canonical NOTCH pathway plays in skeletal biology is well understood, our understanding of the role of the non-canonical pathway remains primitive."		9606

TGF-B is a target gene in thyroid cells in the causation of cancer. When TGF-B is activated, the pathway can take 2 directions, through a SMAD pathway or a Non-Smad pathway. Through the SMAD pathway, SMAD separates into SMAD2/3, SMAD4, and involves phosphates into the nuclear signalling. Through the Non-SMAD pathway, the activation of MAPK and Pi3k  causes the activation of ERK, AKT and phosphates, and then into the nuclear signalling. Within the nuclear signalling, EMT-TF has two responses, early and late. With the early response, EMT-TF signals to Id1 and RUNX2, and with the late response, EMT-TF signals to Snai1 and Snai2. Depending on the response also dictates the type of marker that will follow. If early, N-CAD,FN1,VIM,TNC, and CDH6 all cause the activation of the Mesenchymal markers.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3869	Cannabinoid receptor signaling		Endogenous cannabinoid receptors belong to the endocannabinoid system and are located in the mammalian brain and throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems, consisting of neuromodulatory lipids and their receptors. The endocannabinoid system is involved in a variety of physiological processes including appetite, pain-sensation, mood, and memory, and in mediating the psychoactive effects of cannabis. Two primary endocannabinoid receptors have been identified: CNR1 and CNR2. CNR1 is found predominantly in the brain and nervous system, as well as in peripheral organs and tissues, and are the main molecular target of the endocannabinoid ligand (binding molecule), Anandamide, as well as its mimetic phytocannabinoid, THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). One other main endocannabinoid is 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) which is active at both cannabinoid receptors, along with its own mimetic phytocannabinoid, CBD (cannabidiol). 2-AG and CBD are involved in the regulation of appetite, immune system functions and pain management.Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system Not all MAPK subtypes are relevant for this pathway.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3871	Valproic acid pathway		Valproic acid is a drug used for treatment and management of seizure disorders, mania and prophylactic treatment of migraine headache. In epileptics, valproic acid is used to control absence seizures, tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal), complex partial seizures, and the seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Valproic Acid dissociates to the valproate ion in the gastrointestinal tract and then binds to and inhibits GABA transaminase. The drug's anticonvulsant activity may be related to increased brain concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, by inhibiting enzymes that catabolize GABA or block the reuptake of GABA into glia and nerve endings. Valproic Acid may also work by suppressing repetitive neuronal firing through inhibition of voltage-sensitive sodium channels. It is also a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Valproic acid has also been shown to be an inhibitor of an enzyme called histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). HDAC1 is needed for HIV to remain in infected cells. A study published in August 2005 revealed that patients treated with valproic acid in addition to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) showed a 75% reduction in latent HIV infection.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3888	VEGFA-VEGFR2 signaling		Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature, is central to a number of physiological conditions, from embryogenesis to wound healing in adults and is a hallmark of pathological conditions such as tumorigenesis [1-3]. Angiogenesis is mediated by the coordinated action of a variety of growth factors, metabolites and cell adhesion molecules in endothelial cells [4-6]. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the principal angiogenic growth factor modulating neovascularization [7].The biological effect of VEGF is mediated through specific VEGF receptors on endothelial cell surface. VEGFs (VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C and VEGF-D) interact with VEGF receptors such as VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3. Among them, VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling appears to mediate cellular responses involved in angiogenesis prominently. Further, VEGF/VEGFR1 signaling, though weak, converges to VEGFR2 signaling pathway. VEGFA binding to VEGFR2 at the surface of endothelial cells leads to dimerization and auto-phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of VEGFR2. It leads to activation of multiple downstream signaling cascades and promotes endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation relevant to angiogenesis [8]. VEGFR2 dependent activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling regulates cell survival, cell proliferation, anti-apoptotic and cell permeability functions [9]. Another important pathway of VEGF mediated cell proliferation appears to be through PLCÎ³-mediated activation of PKC and downstream induction of the ERK and other PKC-dependent pathways [10]. Endothelial cell migration is induced by VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling through activation of p38MAPK (actin polymerization) and FAK (focal adhesion turnover) which is particularly important in directed migration. Phosphosite specificity towards downstream signalling has also been documented. Phosphosite mapping documented seven phosphosites in VEGFR2 receptor: Y1054, Y1214, Y801, Y1175, Y951, Y1059 and Y996. Phosphorylation of Y1214 and Y1054 regulates signaling events involved in cell migration. Y801 phosphorylation regulates cell survival. Y1175 regulates both cell proliferation and migration. Y951 and Y1059 phosphorylation regulates cell survival, cell migration and cell proliferation.VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling network compiles data available in the literature with respect to VEGFA signaling (especially VEGFA-165) through VEGFR2 in endothelial cells. The signaling events involving these proteins were derived from experimentally validated data involving multiple experimental techniques and approaches. Individual signaling events in VEGFR2 signaling networks leading to cell proliferation, migration and survival were identified and categorized into protein-protein interactions, enzyme-catalyzed events, activation/inhibition reactions, transport of protein across subcellular compartments, and gene regulation events. Signaling molecules involved in VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling were categorized to enzymes, receptors and transcription factors and the contextual activation/deactivation of these molecules downstream to VEGFA/ VEGFR2 signaling, in modulating angiogenesis, is documented.VEGFA dependent angiogenesis pathway map depicts the integration of signaling pathways regulating cell survival, cell migration, cell proliferation, cellular interactions downstream of VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling relevant to angiogenesis, regulation of VEGFR2, phosphosite specificity of VEGFR2 towards downstream signaling, post-translational modifications, molecular function-based information, cross-talks among proteins in the canonical signaling modules and the information on the compartmentalization of proteins. The map of VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling network is interactive to help investigators to add new information as it becomes available in the future for analysis or representation.VEGFA dependent angiogenesis pathway map may please be cited as: 1.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3890	Nanomaterial-induced inflammasome activation		This is a schematic diagram illustrating putative pathways for NAMP (nanomaterial-associated molecular patters)-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) eg. lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on the cell membrane, which leads to NF-κB activation and upregulation of pro-interleukin (IL)-1β and NLRP3 expression. High aspect radio nanomaterials (i.e. long multiwalled carbon nanotubes) are thought to trigger “frustrated phagocytosis” in macrophages, leading to NADPH oxidase (NOX1) activation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and inflammasome activation. Smaller nanomaterials (i.e. short carbon nanotubes or silver nanoparticles of 28 nm), on the other hand, could be phagocytosed and once inside the cell induce lysosomal damage leading to release of cathepsins which cause mitochondrial damage and ROS production. In both cases, interaction of phagocytes with NAMPs induces an overproduction of ROS which results in assembly of NLRP3, ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), and pro-caspase-1 into the multimeric inflammasome complex, resulting in activation of caspase-1, and release of mature IL-1β, a key pro-inflammatory mediator.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3892	Development of pulmonary dendritic cells and macrophage subsets		Development of pulmonary DC and macrophage subsets. This model of pulmonary DC and macrophage subset differentiation in mice summarizes recent findings suggesting early lineage commitment of cDCs in the BM and differentiation of monocytes into different population with DC, macrophage, or suppressive functions. All DC subsets present in the lung originate from hematopoietic progenitors (HSC) that differentiate into a common myeloid progenitor (CMP). Such CMPs further differentiate to a common DC progenitors (CDPs) or macrophage DC progenitors (MDPs). MDPs give rise to a common monocyte precursor (cMoP). In a CSF-1-dependent mechanism, Ly6Chi monocytes develop, which can further differentiate into Ly6Clo monocytes. Such Ly6Clo monocytes may also derive directly from cMoPs. Both monocyte populations can enter the lung and become monocyte-derived DCs, macrophages, or suppressor cells (25, 62). CDPs also serve as precursors for pDCs and pre-cDCs. Recent studies suggest that the two cDC populations deriving from the pre-cDC progenitor, i.e., CD103+ cDCs and CD11b+ cDCs, arise already in the bone marrow as pre-cDC1/cDC2 subtypes. One study suggested that pulmonary monocytes may differentiate into pulmonary CD103+ and CD11b+ DC; however, it is unclear whether such cells are phenotypically and functionally identical to CD103+ and CD11b+ cDCs. Activation of defined transcription factors (in blue) at distinct time points is critical for lineage commitment of the different DC precursors. During the early developmental stages, important transcription factors include STAT3, IRF8, and PU.1. At later stages, E2-2 is decisive for pDC commitment of CDPs. BATF3 and IRF8 are associated with the CD103+ cDC and IRF4 with the CD11b+ differentiation. In addition to the transcription factors, several growth factors (in green) play key functions in the development of pre-cDCs and the different DC subsets, in particular Flt3L, CSF-1 (M-CSF), and CSF-2 (GM-CSF). The lung contains two major macrophage populations, i.e., alveolar and interstitial macrophages (AMs and IMs, respectively). It is now well appreciated that AMs derive from yolk sac and fetal liver progenitors that colonize the embryonic lung and are maintained by self-renewal at steady state. The origin of IMs remains elusive. Some data suggest that they represent monocyte-derived macrophages.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3892 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606

CHILPs can further differentiate into LTi cells through α4β7+ populations or into other ILC populations through differentiation into ILCps. ILC1s express T-bet, are responsive to IL-12, and produce IFN-γ and/or TNF. ILC2s highly express GATA3, are responsive to IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP, and produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13 and amphiregulin.

It culminates in the formation of thrombin, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of soluble fibrinogen to the insoluble fibrin clot.The kallikrein-kinin system is an endogenous metabolic cascade, triggering of which results in the release of vasoactive kinins (bradykinin-related peptides). Kinin peptides are implicated in many physiological and pathological processes including the regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis, inflammatory processes, and the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning.Complement is a system of plasma proteins that is activated by the presence of pathogens. There are three pathways of complement activation: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. All of these pathways generate a crucial enzymatic activity that, intern, generates the effector molecules of complement. The three main consequences of complement activation are the opsonization of pathogens, the recruitment of inflammatory and immunocompetent cells, and the direct killing of pathogens.Source: KEGG (http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway:map04610)		9606

It also results in the production of primary miR-146a (pri-miR-146a) that is subsequently processed into mature miR-146a that silences the expression of key TLR-adaptor molecules interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). The production of miR-146a thereby serves as a regulatory feedback loop to suppress NF-κB activity and resolve inflammation. Findings from our study identified that cellular apoE expression contributes to amplify this regulatory feedback loop by increasing PU.1-dependent transcription of pri-miR-146a and thereby mature miR-146a production.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3926 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3927	BMP signaling in eyelid development		The signaling pathways involved in eyelid development are displayed with interactions that are known (solid arrows) and proposed (dotted arrows). The four main pathways shown are activated by Fgf10 and regulate key processes, but also interact with each other. The first pathway is a proposed promotion of sfrp1 which inhibits Wnt that regulates the Meibomian Gland. The Wnt pathway also activates pitx2 and begins the proposed pathway to eyelid closure. The second pathway begins with Fgfr2 activating Bmp4, a protein that may also be regulated by Shh, and continuing through a protein chain to regulate conjunctival cell fate. In this pathway Bmp also inhibits transdifferentiation of Meibomian Gland into a hair follicle, conjunctiva proliferation, and precocious differentiation. The last two pathways are linked to the regulation of eyelid closure through a cascade of protein activation and is further promoted by Bmp through stimulation of phosphorylated c-Jun.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3932	Focal adhesion: PI3K-Akt-mTOR-signaling pathway		Cell-matrix adhesions play important roles in biological processes such as cell motility, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, regulation of gene expression and cell survival. Focal adhesions are structures formed at the cell-extracellular matrix contact points, consisting of bundles of actin filaments anchored to trans-membrane receptors of the integrin family through a complex of multiple proteins. In addition to participating in the structural link between membrane receptors and the actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesions also contain signaling molecules, such as protein kinases and phosphatases, their substrates, and various adapter proteins. Integrin signaling is dependent on the non-receptor tyrosine kinase activities of the FAK and src proteins and the adaptor protein functions of FAK, src and Shc to initiate downstream signaling events. These signaling events results in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for changes in cell shape and motility, and gene expression.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP395	IL-4 signaling pathway		IL-4 is a glycoprotein which is composed of 129 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 20kDa. IL-4 and IL-13 are produced by CD4+ cells and exhibit significant functional overlap. Both these cytokines play a critical role in the promotion of allergic responses. IL-4 is primarily involved in promoting the differentiation and proliferation of T helper 2 (TH2) cells and the synthesis of immunoglobulin E (IgE). Apart from its role in allergic responses including asthma, IL-4 was also found to regulate retinal progenitor proliferation, rod photoreceptor differentiation, cholinergic and GABAergic amacrine differentiation and neuroprotection and survival. IL-4 was also found to have regulatory effects in a number of neurological diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Multiple sclerosis, Experimental autoimmune encephelitis. It was also found to relieve inflammatory and neuropathic pain. IL-4 is capable of exerting its biological activities through interaction with two cell surface receptor complexes - Type I IL4 receptor and Type II IL4 Receptor. Both these receptor complexes comprise of a common IL4RÎ± (CD124) subunit, which is also the functional receptor chain. Type I IL-4 receptor is formed by the interaction of IL4RÎ± subunit with IL-2Î³c (CD132). Type II IL-4 receptor is formed by the interaction of IL-4RÎ± subunit with IL-13RÎ±. Interaction of IL-4 with its receptor results in receptor dimerization and activation. The Type I receptors activates JAK1 and 3, which are associated with the receptor subunits. The activated JAK phosphorylates tyrosine residues the cytoplasmic tails of the receptor which then serves as docking sites for a number of adaptor or signaling molecules including STAT6. Activated STAT6 dimerizes, translocated to the nucleus and transcriptionally actives genes responsive to IL-4. Many of the key functions of IL4 allergic disorders, including TH2 cell differentiation, airway hyper responsiveness, mucus cell metaplasia and IgE synthesis are dependent on STAT6 activation. Other phosphorylated tyrosine residue bind to proteins with phospho-tyrosine binding (PTB) motifs including IRS proteins. This results in the phosphorylation of the IRS proteins, which can then potentially activate the PI3K/AKT cascade by binding to the p85 subunit of PI3K or the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. The PI3K/AKT pathway is thought to mediate the growth and survival signals in multiple IL-4 responsive cell types including T- and B- lymphocytes and natural killer cells.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_4_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite the following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3958	GPR40 pathway		G-protein-coupled receptor GPR40 (also known as Free fatty acid receptor 1(FFAR1)) is a seven trans-membrane domain receptor which is predominantly expressed in pancreatic beta cells. It plays an essential role in fatty acid ampliï¬�cation of glucose induced insulin secretion. GPR40 agonists are in second phase of preclinical trials for treatment of diabetes because of their role in improved glucose control.  Binding of free fatty acids to GPR40 initiates a downstream signaling cascade which involves activation of a transducer protein â€œguanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit alpha-11â€�  (GNA11). Next phospholipase c (PLC) hormone is activated which hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids (such as phosphatidylinositol-4-5-biphosphate) into second messenger molecules inositol-1-4-5-trophosphate (IP3) and Diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 initiates calcium efflux from endoplasmic reticulum and increase intracellular calcium concentration.  Increased intracellular calcium concentration is involved in activating the insulin exocytosis machinery. DAG on the other hand activates PKD1. PKD1 initiates F-actin remodeling and supports second phase of insulin exocytosis.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3959	DNA IR-double strand breaks and cellular response via ATM		Wide-ranging correlations are found between the initial physical features of radiation exposure and the possibility of biological consequences. These persist even with the chain of physical, chemical and biological processes that eliminate the majority of the early damage.Ionizing radiations (IRs) generate hundreds of different simple chemical products in DNA as well multitudes of clustered combinations. The simple products, including single-strand breaks (SSBs), tend to correlate poorly with biological effectiveness. However, when IR produce double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA it comes a large rise in relative biological response to cellular damage. In general terms, IRs produce a wide variety of DNA lesions and DSBs are considered to be the major actor responsible for cell death. If unrepaired or improperly repaired, DSBs contribute to chromosomal aberrations, which may lead to human disorders including cancer. The accurate preservation of chromosome continuity in human cells during either DNA replication or repair is critical for preventing the conversion of normal cells to an oncogenic status.The production of DSBs can be quantified by biochemical techniques, e.g., pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and cell imaging, either globally or damage specific, through immunostaining of marker proteins or recruitment of fluorescent proteins to the DNA breaks.In vertebrate cells, the elimination of DSBs with minimal nucleotide sequence change involves the spatiotemporal orchestration of an apparently endless number of proteins ranging, according to their action, from the nucleotide level to nucleosome organization and chromosome architecture. DSBs trigger a multitude of post-translational modifications that alter both, catalytic activities and the specificity of protein interactions including: phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitylation, acetylation, and SUMOylation, followed by the turnaround of these changes as repair has been completed.In mammalian cells, the formation of DSBs initiates a massive global cellular response, either checkpoint signaling and repair or cell death (apoptosis). A major role is that of the MRN (MRE11/RAD50/NBS1) complex binding to DSBs and facilitating the activation of ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated) protein, a key PI3K (Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) related kinase in the DNA damage response (DDR). At the break site, ATM autophosphorylates, allowing its activation and the following phosphorylation of several substrates in the surrounding chromatin.The following pathway diagrams the early events of the cellular response after DSBs by IR through the activation of ATM in human cells.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3965	Lipid metabolism pathway		Lipid metabolism is the break down or storage of fats for energy; these fats are obtained from consuming food and absorbing them or they are synthesized by an animal's liver. Lipid metabolism does exist in plants, though the processes differ in some ways when compared to animals. Lipogenesis is the process of synthesizing these fats. Lipid metabolism often begins with hydrolysis, which occurs when a chemical breaks down as a reaction to coming in contact with water. Since lipids (fats) are hydrophobic, hydrolysis in lipid metabolism occurs in the cytoplasm which ends up creating glycerol and fatty acids. Due to the hydrophobic nature of lipids they require special transport proteins known as lipoproteins, which are hydrophilic. Lipoproteins are categorized by their density levels. The varying densities between the types of lipoproteins are characteristic to what type of fats they transport. A number of these lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver, but not all of them originate from this organ.Description source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_metabolism Wikipedia]Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3965 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606

This gene is located on chromosome 20p13 and is composed of two exons. Mutations in the PRNP gene cause conformational changes in the prion protein (PRNP). The normal PRNP (protein) changes into the pathologic PRNP. A molecular pathway can give a better understanding in prion diseases.This pathway is a prion disease pathway, that describes what happens when there is a mutation in the PRNP gene. The left part of the pathway represents the pathway retrieved from literature and the right part of the pathway represents data found using databases. The left part shos the interaction of pathological prion protein with an unknown receptor protein, this interaction activates a signalling pathway. The endoplasmic reticulum releases calcium and ER stress is induced. Activation of Caspase 12 by ER-stress is followed by cleavage and activation of the executioner Caspase-3, causing neuronal apoptosis. According to the databases, NCAM-1 can initiate two mechanisms: the activation of FGFR and formation of intracellular signalling complexes. NCAM-1 interacts with Fyn and FAK, resulting in phosphorylation of these two tyrosine kinases. Phosphorylation of Fyn and FAK results in activation of MAPK, ERK1 and 2, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and transcription factors ELK and NFkB.

As with other MAPK cascades, the membrane-proximal component is a MAPKKK, typically a MEKK or a mixed lineage kinase (MLK). The MAPKKK phosphorylates and activated MKK3/5, the p38 MAPK kinase. MKK3/6 can also be activated directly by ASK1, which is stimulated by apoptotic stimuli. P38 MAK is involved in regulation of Hsp27 and MAPKAP-2 and several transcription factors including ATF2, STAT1, THE Max/Myc complex, MEF-2, ELK-1 and indirectly CREB via activation of MSK1.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP400 CPTAC Assay Portal].		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4016	DNA IR-damage and cellular response via ATR		In fission yeast, the rad3 gene product plays a critical role in sensing DNA structure defects and activating damage response pathways. A structural homologue of rad3 in humans has been identified based on sequence similarity in the protein kinase domain.  ATR (for Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related) is considered the mammalian counterpart of yeast rad3, Mec1p, and fruit fly Mei-41, proteins involved in DNA damage responses.The ATR protein is a member of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase related kinase family and plays an important role in UV-induced DNA damage checkpoint response and its role as a signal transducer in cell cycle checkpoint has been well established.  Even though it is currently unclear whether ATR functions as a damage sensor, recent evidence shows that ATR may function as an initial sensor in the DNA damage checkpoint response.  Moreover, it has been found that ATR is a DNA-binding protein with higher affinity to UV-damaged than undamaged DNA.  In addition, damaged DNA stimulates the kinase activity of ATR to a significantly higher level than undamaged DNA.ATR is structurally related to ATM (for Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated) as well as the yeast PIK family members Mec1p and Rad3.  Mec1p and Rad3 participate in checkpoint pathways induced by DNA replication blocks, DNA strand breaks, and other chromosomal abnormalities, which implies that ATR performs similar functions in mammalian cells.  Reports have demonstrated that overexpression of a catalytically inactive version of ATR (ATRki) in human fibroblasts caused hypersensitivity to gamma-radiation and hydroxyurea and abrogation of the radiation-induced G2 checkpoint.  The checkpoint defects observed in ATR-overexpressing cells resemble those found in AT cells.Additionally, ATR functions as an upstream regulator of p53 phosphorylation in DNA-damaged cells.  ATR phosphorylates p53 at both Ser-15 and Ser-37 in vitro, suggesting that ATR is directly involved in the modification of p53 in DNA-damaged cells.  Recent reports concerning ATM, suggest that ATR and ATM play both overlapping and independent roles in the phosphorylation of p53 during cellular exposure to genotoxic stress.Atr is localized to the nuclei of primary spermatocytes, cells that are undergoing meiosis I.  It has been demonstrated that both Atr and Atm proteins have associated protein kinase activity, consistent with their primary structures.  Additionally, Atr and Atm show specific association with chromosomes in cells that are in early meiosis I as demonstrated by antibody localization on surface-spread spermatocytes.  Both the Atr and Atm proteins are present at pairing forks in meiotic prophase as chromosomes synapse; however, they do not colocalize, instead they occupy complementary positions: Atr localizes along unsynapsed chromosome axes and Atm interacts with synapsed axes.Meanwhile ATM is activated by damage-induced rapid intermolecular autophosphorylation prior relocalization to sites of DNA breaks, ATR activation seems to require single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) coated with replication protein A.  The recruitment of ATR to damage sites appears to be mediated by an ATR-interacting protein that forms a stable complex with the vast majority of ATR in human cells.		9606

The resulting HIF-α–HIF-β-induced up-regulation of downstream genes promotes cell proliferation, glucose uptake, glycolysis, and angiogenesis. Mutations in chromatin remodelers and histone modifiers including PBRM1, SETD2, BAP1 and KDM5C lead to global abnormal gene expression patterns, and deficiency in DNA repair, which contributes to genomic instability. Activation of PI3K–mTOR signaling promotes cell proliferation and tumor aggression, and increases translation of HIF-α, leading to enhanced HIF-α-mediated gene expression.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4022	Pyrimidine metabolism		Pyrimidines are nucleic acids and the products of pyrimidine degradation are water-soluble. The pyrimidine ring is synthesized before it is conjugated to PRPP. The first reaction is the conjugation of carbamoyl phosphate and aspartate to make N-carbamoylaspartate. The carbamoyl phosphate synthetase used in pyrimidine biosynthesis is located in the cytoplasm. The enzyme that carries out the reaction is aspartate transcarbamoylase, an enzyme that is closely regulated. The second reaction is ring closure to form dihydroorotic acid by the enzyme dihydroorotase. This circular product contains a 6-membered ring with nitrogen and carbons located in the same positions as in the mature pyrimidine ring. The third reaction is the oxidation of the ring to form a carbon- carbon bond. The reducing equivalents are transferred to a flavin cofactor of the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The product is orotic acid. Fourth, the orotate ring is transferred to phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to form a 5-ribose-phosphate, orotidylic acid. Finally orotidylate is decarboxylated to yield UMP, which of course contains one of the bases of RNA. Cellular kinases convert UMP to UTP. Transfer of an amido nitrogen from glutamine by CTP synthetase converts UTP to CTP; this reaction uses an ATP high-energy phosphate. Pyrimidine synthesis is controlled at the first committed step. ATP stimulates the aspartate transcarbamoylase reaction, while CTP inhibits it. CTP is a feedback inhibitor of the pathway, and ATP is a feed-forward activator. This regulation ensures that a balanced supply of purines and pyrimidines exists for RNA and synthesis.Eukaryotic organisms contain a multifunctional enzyme with carbamoylphosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamoylase, and dihydroorotase activities. Two mechanisms control this enzyme. First, control at the level of enzyme synthesis exists; the transcription of the gene for the enzyme is reduced if an excess of pyrimidines is present. Secondly, control exists at the level of feedback inhibition by pyrimidine nucleotides. This enzyme is also an example of the phenomenon of metabolic channeling: aspartate, ammonia, and carbon dioxide enter the enzyme and come out as orotic acidDescription text is based on [https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/biology/biochemistry-ii/purines-and-pyrimidines/pyrimidine-metabolism Cliff's Notes].Pathway is based on [https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+map00240 KEGG]Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4022 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4030	SCFA and skeletal muscle substrate metabolism		The short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) acetate, propionate and butyrate can alter skeletal muscle metabolism both via direct and indirect mechanisms. Indirect mechanisms include the stimulation of glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) release via G-protein coupled receptor 41 (GPR41) and GPR43 signalling. Increased peripheral levels of these gut-derived satiety hormones induce the recruitment of microvasculature in skeletal muscle tissue and thereby contribute to improved insulin signalling. Furthermore SCFA induce a reduction in lipolysis in white adipose tissue (WAT), resulting in enhanced WAT lipid buffering capacity and decreased levels ectopic fat accumulation in skeletal muscle tissue. SCFA are also suggested to have direct effects on skeletal muscle metabolism, possibly via GPR41 and GPR43 signalling. SCFA  induce the activation of  adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator in skeletal muscle cell metabolism. Activated AMPK induces several metabolic pathways including fatty acid oxidation and the synthesis of glycogen. Active AMPK also stimulates glucose uptake via translocation of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and decreases glycolysis. In addition to AMPK activation, SCFA might also induce peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta (PPARD) expression, another process contributing to enhanced fat oxidation levels.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4034	Mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation		Beta-oxidation begins once fatty acids have been imported into the mitochondrial matrix by carnitine acyltransferases. The beta-oxidation spiral of fatty acids metabolism involves the repetitive removal of two carbon units from the fatty acyl chain. There are four steps to this process: oxidation, hydration, a second oxidation, and finally thiolysis. The last step releases the two-carbon acetyl-CoA and a ready primed acyl-CoA that takes another turn down the spiral. In total each turn of the beta-oxidation spiral produces one NADH, one FADH2, and one acetyl-CoA.<p>Further oxidation of acetyl-CoA via the tricarboxylic acid cycle generates additional FADH2 and NADH. All reduced cofactors are used by the mitochondrial electron transport chain to form ATP. The complete oxidation of a fatty acid molecule produces numerous ATP molecules. Palmitate, used as the model here, produces 129 ATPs.<p>Beta-oxidation pathways differ for saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The beta-oxidation of saturated fatty acids requires four different enzymatic steps. Beta-oxidation produces and consumes intermediates with a trans configuration; unsaturated fatty acids that have bonds in the cis configuration require three separate enzymatic steps to prepare these molecules for the beta-oxidation pathway.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4036	MTF1 activates gene expression		The MTF1:zinc complex in the nucleus binds Metal Response Elements (MREs), DNA containing the core consensus sequence 5'-TGCRCNC-3', and activates or represses transcription depending on the context of the MRE (reviewed in Laity and Andrews 2007, Jackson et al. 2008, Gunther et al. 2012, Grzywacz et al. 2015). The 6 zinc fingers of each MTF1 monomer have different affinities for zinc and evidence from the mouse homolog indicates that different concentrations of zinc, and hence different metal loads in MTF1, activate different subsets of target genes (Wang et al. 2004, Dong et al. 2015). Genes activated by MTF1 include those encoding metallothioneins, zinc transporters, and stress-response proteins (Hardyman et al. 2016).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4037	Pyrophosphate hydrolysis		Many biosynthetic reactions are coupled to the cleavage of ATP to yield AMP and pyrophosphate.  These reactions are typically freely reversible when carried out with purified substrates and enzymes in vitro.  In vivo, however, the pyrophosphate is rapdily and essentially irreversibly hydrolyzed by a ubiquitous inorganic pyrophosphatase. This hydrolysis has the effect of pulling the first reaction strongly in the direction of biosynthesis, at the expense of two high-energy phosphate bonds. Studies of human cells have identified two forms of the enzyme, one localized to the cytosol and the other to the mitochondrial matrix (Raja et al. 1981).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4038	Transcription from mitochondrial promoters		Thirteen of the ~80 different proteins present in the respiratory chain of human mitochondria are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). The circular mtDNA, which is present in 1000 to 10000 copies in the human cell, also encodes for 2 ribosomal RNAs, and 22 transfer RNAs. The double-stranded mitochondrial genome lacks introns and the longer non-coding region contains the control elements for transcription and replication of mtDNA  (Shadel and Clayton,  1997).   The two mtDNA strands are referred to as the heavy  (H-strand) and the light  (L-strand) due to their differing  G+T content.  In human cells, each strand contains one single promoter for transcriptional initiation, the light-strand promoter (LSP) or the heavy-strand promoter (HSP). Transcription from the mitochondrial promoters produce polycistronic precursor RNA encompassing all the genetic information encoded in each of the specific strands. The primary transcripts are processed to produce the individual tRNA and mRNA molecules (Clayton, 1991; Ojala et al., 1981). There is likely a second initiation site for heavy strand transcription, which produces RNAs spanning the rDNA region. The resulting transcript  including  the genes for the two mitochondrial rRNAs and ends at the boundary between the 16 S rRNA and the tRNALeu(UUR) genes (Montoya et al., 1982; Montoya et al.,1983; Christianson and Clayton 1986). The existence of such a separate transcription unit may explain why the steady-state levels of rRNAs are much higher than the steady state levels of mRNAs.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4039	Fructose metabolism		Fructose is found in fruits, is one of the components of the disaccharide sucrose, and is a widely used sweetener in processed foods. Dietary fructose is catabolized in the liver via fructose 1-phosphate to yield dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which then are converted to pyruvate via steps of canonical glycolysis (Hers & Kusaka 1953; Sillero et al. 1969). Excessive dietary intake of fructose and its metabolism have been associated with major disease risks in humans, although this issue remains controversial (Kolderup & Svihus 2015; DiNicolantonio et al. 2015; Bray 2013; Mayes 1993; Rippe & Angelopoulos 2013; van Buul et al. 2013). Fructose can also be synthesized from glucose via the polyol pathway (Hers 1960; Oates 2008). This synthetic process provides the fructose found in seminal fluid and, in other tissues, can contribute to pathologies of diabetes.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4042	Nucleobase catabolism		The purine bases guanine and hypoxanthine (derived from adenine by events in the purine salvage pathways) are converted to xanthine and then to uric acid, which is excreted from the body (Watts 1974). The end-point of this pathway in humans and hominoid primates is unusual. Most other mammals metabolize uric acid further to yield more soluble end products, and much speculation has centered on possible roles for high uric acid levels in normal human physiology.<p>In parallel sequences of three reactions each, the pyrimidines thymine and uracil are converted to beta-aminoisobutyrate and beta-alanine respectively. Both of these molecules are excreted in human urine and appear to be normal end products of pyrimidine catabolism (Griffith 1986). Mitochondrial AGXT2, however, can also catalyze the transamination of both molecules with pyruvate, yielding 2-oxoacids that can be metabolized further by reactions of branched-chain amino acid and short-chain fatty acid catabolism (Tamaki et al. 2000).<p>Hydrolysis of phosphate bonds in nucleotides catalyzed by members of the NUDT and NTPD families of enzymes have been grouped here as well, although the physiological roles of these groups of  catabolic reactions are diverse.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4043	Cellular hexose transport		Two gene families are responsible for glucose transport in humans. SLC2 (encoding GLUTs) and SLC5 (encoding SGLTs) families mediate glucose absorption in the small intestine, glucose reabsorption in the kidney, glucose uptake by the brain across the blood-brain barrier and glucose release by all cells in the body. Glucose is taken up from interstitial fluid by a passive, facilitative transport driven by the diffusion gradient of glucose (and other sugars) across the plasma membrane. This process is mediated by a family of Na+-independent, facilitative glucose transporters (GLUTs) encoded by the SLC2A gene family (Zhao & Keating 2007; Wood & Trayhurn 2003). There are 14 members belonging to this family (GLUT1-12, 14 and HMIT (H+/myo-inositol symporter)). The GLUT family can be subdivided into three subclasses (I-III) based on sequence similarity and characteristic sequence motifs (Joost & Thorens 2001).<p>Hexoses, notably fructose, glucose, and galactose, generated in the lumen of the small intestine by breakdown of dietary carbohydrate are taken up by enterocytes lining the microvilli of the small intestine and released from them into the blood. Uptake into enterocytes is mediated by two transporters localized on the lumenal surfaces of the cells, SGLT1 (glucose and galactose, together with sodium ions) and GLUT5 (fructose). GLUT2, localized on the basolateral surfaces of enterocytes, mediates the release of these hexoses into the blood (Wright et al. 2004). GLUT2 may also play a role in hexose uptake from the gut lumen into enterocytes when the lumenal content of monosaccharides is very high (Kellet & Brot-Laroche 2005) and GLUT5 mediates fructose uptake from the blood into cells of the body, notably hepatocytes.<p>Cells take up glucose by facilitated diffusion, via glucose transporters (GLUTs) associated with the plasma membrane, a reversible reaction. Four tissue-specific GLUT isoforms are known. Glucose in the cytosol is phosphorylated by tissue-specific kinases to yield glucose 6-phosphate, which cannot cross the plasma membrane because of its negative charge. In the liver, this reaction is catalyzed by glucokinase which has a low affinity for glucose (Km about 10 mM) but is not inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate. In other tissues, this reaction is catalyzed by isoforms of hexokinase. Hexokinases are feedback-inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate and have a high affinity for glucose (Km about 0.1 mM). Liver cells can thus accumulate large amounts of glucose 6-phosphate but only when blood glucose concentrations are high, while most other tissues can take up glucose even when blood glucose concentrations are low but cannot accumulate much intracellular glucose 6-phosphate. These differences are consistent with the view that that the liver functions to buffer blood glucose concentrations, while most other tissues take up glucose to meet immediate metabolic needs.<p>Glucose 6-phosphatase, expressed in liver and kidney, allows glucose 6-phosphate generated by gluconeogenesis (both tissues) and glycogen breakdown (liver) to leave the cell. The absence of glucose 6-phosphatase from other tissues makes glucose uptake by these tissues essentially irreversible, consistent with the view that cells in these tissues take up glucose for local metabolic use.<p>Class II facilitative transporters consist of GLUT5, 7, 9 and 11 (Zhao & Keating 2007, Wood & Trayhurn 2003).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4046	Receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatases		Like neurexins, Receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) make trans-synaptic adhesion complexes with multiple postsynaptic binding partners to regulate synapse organization. The type IIa RPTPs include three members, Receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase F (PTPRF) sometimes referred to as leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR), Receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase sigma (PTPRS) and Receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase delta (PTPRD). These proteins contain typical cell adhesion immunoglobulin-like (Ig) and fibronectin III (FNIII) domains, suggesting the involvement of RPTPs in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. To date, six different types of postsynaptic organizers for type-IIa RPTPs have been reported: interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP, IL-1RAcP) (Yoshida et al. 2012), IL-1RAcP-like-1 (IL1RAPL1) (Yoshida et al. 2011), Neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (NTRK3, TrkC) (Takahashi et al. 2011), Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 4B (LRRC4B, Netrin-G ligand-3, NGL-3) (Woo et al. 2009, Kwon et al. 2010), the Slit- and Trk-like (Slitrk) family proteins (Takahashi et al. 2012, Yim et al. 2013, Yamagata et al. 2015) and the liprins (Serra-PagÃ¨s et al. 1998, Dunah et al. 2005).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4047	PTEN Regulation		PTEN is regulated at the level of gene transcription, mRNA translation, localization and protein stability.<p>Transcription of the PTEN gene is regulated at multiple levels. Epigenetic repression involves the recruitment of Mi-2/NuRD upon SALL4 binding to the PTEN promoter (Yang et al. 2008, Lu et al. 2009) or EVI1-mediated recruitment of the polycomb repressor complex (PRC) to the PTEN promoter (Song et al. 2009, Yoshimi et al. 2011). Transcriptional regulation is also elicited by negative regulators, including NR2E1:ATN1 (atrophin-1) complex, JUN (c-Jun), SNAIL and SLUG (Zhang et al. 2006, Vasudevan et al. 2007, Escriva et al. 2008, Uygur et al. 2015) and positive regulators such as TP53 (p53), MAF1, ATF2, EGR1 or PPARG (Stambolic et al. 2001, Virolle et al. 2001, Patel et al. 2001, Shen et al. 2006, Li et al. 2016).<p>MicroRNAs miR-26A1, miR-26A2, miR-22, miR-25, miR-302, miR-214, miR-17-5p, miR-19 and miR-205 bind PTEN mRNA and inhibit its translation into protein. These microRNAs are altered in cancer and can account for changes in PTEN levels (Meng et al. 2007, Xiao et al. 2008, Yang et al. 2008, Huse et al. 2009, Kim et al. 2010, Poliseno, Salmena, Riccardi et al. 2010, Cai et al. 2013). In addition, coding and non-coding RNAs can prevent microRNAs from binding to PTEN mRNA. These RNAs are termed competing endogenous RNAs or ceRNAs. Transcripts of the pseudogene PTENP1 and mRNAs transcribed from SERINC1, VAPA and CNOT6L genes exhibit this activity (Poliseno, Salmena, Zhang et al. 2010, Tay et al. 2011, Tay et al. 2014).<p>PTEN can translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus after undergoing monoubiquitination. PTEN's ability to localize to the nucleus contributes to its tumor suppressive role (Trotman et al. 2007). The ubiquitin protease USP7 (HAUSP) targets monoubiquitinated PTEN in the nucleus, resulting in PTEN deubiquitination and nuclear exclusion. PML, via an unknown mechanism that involves USP7- and PML-interacting protein DAXX, inhibits USP7-mediated deubiquitination of PTEN, thus promoting PTEN nuclear localization. Disruption of PML function in acute promyelocytic leukemia, through a chromosomal translocation that results in expression of a fusion protein PML-RARA, leads to aberrant PTEN localization (Song et al. 2008).<p>Several ubiquitin ligases, including NEDD4, WWP2, STUB1 (CHIP), RNF146, XIAP and MKRN1, polyubiquitinate PTEN and target it for proteasome-mediated degradation (Wang et al. 2007, Van Themsche et al. 2009, Ahmed et al. 2011, Maddika et al. 2011, Lee et al. 2015, Li et al. 2015). The ubiquitin proteases USP13 and OTUD3, frequently down-regulated in breast cancer, remove polyubiquitin chains from PTEN, thus preventing its degradation and increasing its half-life (Zhang et al. 2013, Yuan et al. 2015). The catalytic activity of PTEN is negatively regulated by PREX2 binding (Fine et al. 2009, Hodakoski et al. 2014) and TRIM27-mediated ubiquitination (Lee et al. 2013), most likely through altered PTEN conformation.<p>In addition to ubiquitination, PTEN also undergoes SUMOylation (Gonzalez-Santamaria et al. 2012, Da Silva Ferrada et al. 2013, Lang et al. 2015, Leslie et al. 2016). SUMOylation of the C2 domain of PTEN may regulate PTEN association with the plasma membrane (Shenoy et al. 2012) as well as nuclear localization of PTEN (Bassi et al. 2013, Collaud et al. 2016). PIASx-alpha, a splicing isorom of E3 SUMO-protein ligase PIAS2 has been implicated in PTEN SUMOylation (Wang et al. 2014). SUMOylation of PTEN may be regulated by activated AKT (Lin et al. 2016). Reactions describing PTEN SUMOylation will be annotated when mechanistic details become available.<p>Phosphorylation affects the stability and activity of PTEN. FRK tyrosine kinase (RAK) phosphorylates PTEN on tyrosine residue Y336, which increases PTEN half-life by inhibiting NEDD4-mediated polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of PTEN. FRK-mediated phosphorylation also increases PTEN enzymatic activity (Yim et al. 2009). Casein kinase II (CK2) constitutively phosphorylates the C-terminal tail of PTEN on serine and threonine residues S370, S380, T382, T383 and S385. CK2-mediated phosphorylation increases PTEN protein stability (Torres and Pulido 2001) but results in ~30% reduction in PTEN lipid phosphatase activity (Miller et al. 2002).<p>PTEN localization and activity are affected by acetylation of its lysine residues (Okumura et al. 2006, Ikenoue et al. 2008, Meng et al. 2016). PTEN can undergo oxidation, which affects its function, but the mechanism is poorly understood (Tan et al. 2015, Shen et al. 2015, Verrastro et al. 2016).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4049	Neutrophil degranulation		Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocytes (white blood cells), indispensable in defending the body against invading microorganisms. In response to infection, neutrophils leave the circulation and migrate towards the inflammatory focus. They contain several subsets of granules that are mobilized to fuse with the cell membrane or phagosomal membrane, resulting in the exocytosis or exposure of membrane proteins. Traditionally, neutrophil granule constituents are described as antimicrobial or proteolytic, but granules also introduce membrane proteins to the cell surface, changing how the neutrophil responds to its environment (Borregaard et al. 2007). Primed neutrophils actively secrete cytokines and other inflammatory mediators and can present antigens via MHC II, stimulating T-cells (Wright et al. 2010).<br><br>Granules form during neutrophil differentiation. Granule subtypes can be distinguished by their content but overlap in structure and composition. The differences are believed to be a consequence of changing protein expression and differential timing of granule formation during the terminal processes of neutrophil differentiation, rather than sorting (Le Cabec et al. 1996). <br> <br>The classical granule subsets are Azurophil or primary granules (AG), secondary granules (SG) and gelatinase granules (GG).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP405	Eukaryotic transcription initiation		In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase, and therefore the initiation of transcription, requires the presence of a core promoter sequence in the DNA. RNA polymerase is able to bind to core promoters in the presence of various specific transcription factors. The most common type of core promoter in eukaryotes is a short DNA sequence known as a TATA box. The TATA box, as a core promoter, is the binding site for a transcription factor known as TATA binding protein (TBP), which is itself a subunit of another transcription factor, called Transcription Factor II D (TFIID). After TFIID binds to the TATA box via the TBP, five more transcription factors and RNA polymerase combine around the TATA box in a series of stages to form a preinitiation complex. One transcription factor, DNA helicase, has helicase activity and so is involved in the separating of opposing strands of double-stranded DNA to provide access to a single-stranded DNA template. However, only a low, or basal, rate of transcription is driven by the preinitiation complex alone. Other proteins known as activators and repressors, along with any associated coactivators or corepressors, are responsible for modulating transcription rate.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4050	Pentose phosphate pathway		The pentose phosphate pathway is responsible for the generation of a substantial fraction of the cytoplasmic NADPH required for biosynthetic reactions, and for the generation of ribose 5-phosphate for nucleotide synthesis. Although the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis are distinct, they involve three common intermediates, glucose 6-phosphate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and fructose 6-phosphate, so the two pathways are interconnected. The pentose phosphate pathway consists of eight reactions:1. Conversion glucose 6-phosphate to D-glucono-1,5-lactone 6-phosphate, with the formation of NADPH; 2. Conversion of D-glucono-1,5-lactone 6-phosphate to 6-phospho-D-gluconate; 3. Conversion of 6-phospho-D-gluconate to ribulose 5-phosphate, with the formation of NADPH; 4. Conversion of ribulose 5-phosphate to xylulose 5-phosphate; 5. Conversion of ribulose 5-phosphate to ribose 5-phosphate; 6. Rearrangement of ribose 5-phosphate and xylulose 5-phosphate to form sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; 7. Rearrangement of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to form erythrose  4-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate; and 8. Rearrangement of xylulose 5-phosphate and erythrose 4-phosphate to form glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate.<P>The oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, reactions 1-3, generates NADPH and pentose 5-phosphate. The non-oxidative branch of the pathway, reactions 4-8, converts pentose 5-phosphate to other sugars.<P>The overall pathway can operate to generate only NADPH (glucose 6-phosphate is converted to pentose 5-phosphates, which are directed to the synthesis of fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which in turn are converted back to glucose 6-phosphate). The reactions of the non-oxidative branch can operate to generate net amounts of ribose 5-phosphate with no production of NADPH.  Net flux through this network of reactions appears to depend on the metabolic state of the cell and the nature of the biosynthetic reactions underway (Casazza and Veech 1987).<p>G6PD, the enzyme that catalyzes the first reaction of the pathway, is more extensively mutated in human populations than any other enzyme, pehaps because these mutant alleles confer malaria resistance (Luzzatto and Afolayan 1968). Mutations affecting other parts of the pathway are rare, though several have been described and studies of their effects have contributed to our understanding of the normal flux of metabolites through this network of reactions (Wamelink et al. 2008).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4051	Lipid particle organization		Lipid droplets (LDs) are cytosolic structures found in cells of all eukaryotes, comprising a monolayer of phospholipids surrounding a core of uncharged lipids such as triglyceride (TAG) and sterol esters. CIDEA, CIDEB and CIDEC were first studied for their roles in promotion of apoptosis but they are also known to play a role in energy metabolism. CIDEA and C bind to lipid droplets and regulate their enlargement, thereby restricting lipolysis and favouring storage (by promoting net neutral lipid transfer from smaller to larger lipid droplets) (Gao & Goodman 2015). LD formation involves the partitioning of neutral lipids from their site of synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytosol. The fat storage-inducing transmembrane proteins 1 and 2 (FITM1 and FITM2), associated with the ER membrane, mediate binding and partitioning of TAGs into LDs. The short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) family is a large family of NAD- or NADP-dependent oxidoreductase enzymes. 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) is a recently-discovered enzyme of unknown physiological function that is associated with lipid droplets and significantly upregulated in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associated protein (HILPDA) is a lipid droplet protein and stimulates intracellular lipid accumulation.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4052	Interleukin-12 family signaling		Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a heterodimer of interleukin-12 subunit alpha (IL12A, IL-12p35) and interleukin-12 subunit beta (IL12B, IL-12p40). It is a potent immunoregulatory cytokine involved in the generation of cell mediated immunity to intracellular pathogens. It is produced by antigen presenting cells, including dendritic cells, macrophages/monocytes, neutrophils and some B cells (D'Andrea et al. 1992, Kobayashi et al.1989, Heufler et al.1996). It enhances the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T cells, stimulating proliferation of activated NK and T cells and induces production of interferon gamma (IFN gamma) by these cells (Stern et al. 1990). IL-12 also plays an important role in immunomodulation by promoting cell mediated immunity through induction of a class 1 T helper cell (Th1) immune response.  IL-12 may contribute to immunopathological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (McIntyre et al. 1996).The receptor for IL-12 is a heterodimer of IL-12Rbeta1 (IL12RB1) and IL-12Rbeta2 (IL12RB2), both highly homologous to Interleukin-6 receptor subunit beta (IL6ST,gp130). Each has an extracellular ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain and a cytosolic domain containing box 1 and box 2 sequences that mediate binding of Janus family tyrosine kinases (JAKs). IL-12 binding is believed to bring about the heterodimerization and generation of a high affinity receptor complex capable of signal transduction. In this model, receptor dimerization leads to juxtaposition of the cytosolic domains and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of JAK2 and TYK2. These activated kinases, in turn, tyrosine phosphorylate and activate several members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family, mainly STAT4, while also STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 have been reported to be activated (Bacon et al. 1995, Jacobson et al. 1995, Yu et al. 1996, Gollob et al.1995). The STATs translocate to the nucleus to activate transcription of several genes, including IFN gamma. The production of IFN gamma has a pleiotropic effect in the cell, stimulating production of molecules important to cell mediated immunity. In particular, IFN gamma stimulates production of more IL-12 and sets up a positive regulation loop between IL-12 signaling and IFN gamma (Chan et al. 1991). The importance of IL-12 for this loop is demonstrated by IL-12 and STAT4 knockout mice that are severely compromised in IFN-gamma production (Kaplan et al. 1996; Magram et al. 1996), as well as by patients with IL12B mutations that are severely compromised in IFN-gamma production (Altare et al.1998).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4053	TBC/RABGAPs		Rab GTPases are peripheral membrane proteins involved in membrane trafficking. Often through their indirect interactions with coat components, motors, tethering factors and SNAREs, the Rab GTPases serve as multifaceted organizers of almost all membrane trafficking processes in eukaryotic cells. To perform these diverse processes, Rab GTPases interconvert between an active GTP-bound form and an inactive, GDP-bound form. The GTP-bound activated form mediates membrane transport through specific interaction with multiple effector molecules (Zerial & McBride 2001, Stenmark 2009, Zhen & Stenmark 2015, Cherfils & Zeghouf 2013). Conversion from the GTP- to the GDP-bound form occurs through GTP hydrolysis, which is not only driven by the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Rab protein but is also catalysed by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). GAPs not only increase the rate of GTP hydrolysis, but they are also involved in the inactivation of RABs, making sure they are inactivated at the correct membrane. Human cells contain as many as 70 Rabs and at least 51 putative Rab GAPs (Pfeffer 2005). Only a few of these GAPs have been matched to a specific Rab substrate. The Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC) domain-containing RAB-specific GAPs (TBC/RABGAPs) are a key family of RAB regulators, where the TBC domain facilitates the inactivation of RABs by facilitating activation of GTPase activity of the RAB (Pan et al. 2006, Frasa et al. 2012, Stenmark 2009). Studies suggest that TBC/RABGAPs are more than just negative regulators of RABs and can integrate signalling between RABs and other small GTPases, thereby regulating numerous cellular processes like intracellular trafficking (Frasa et al. 2012).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4054	Synaptic adhesion-like molecules		Recruitment of receptors and ion channels to the postsynaptic membrane is the last step in synapse formation. Many of these proteins interact directly or indirectly with postsynaptic density-95 (PSD95)/Discs large/zona occludens-1 (PDZ) proteins, thus linking them to the postsynaptic scaffold and providing a mechanism for both retaining the protein at the synapse and keeping its proximity to signaling molecules known to associate with PDZ proteins (Wang et al. 2006, Morimura et al. 2006, Ko et al. 2006, Nourry et al. 2003, Kim & Sheng 2004, Montgomery et al. 2004, Sheng and Kim 2011). The synaptic adhesion-like molecules (SALM) family belongs to the superfamily of leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing adhesion molecules, alternatively referred to as LRFN (leucine-rich repeat and fibronectin III domain-containing) is synapse adhesion molecule linked to NMDA and AMPA receptors. It includes five known members (SALMs 1-5 or LRFN1-5), which have been implicated in the regulation of neurite outgrowth and branching, and synapse formation and maturation. SALM proteins are distributed to both dendrites and axons in neurons (Ko et al. 2006, Wang et al. 2006, Sebold et al. 2012). The family members, SALM1-SALM5, have a single transmembrane (TM) domain and contain extracellular leucine-rich repeats, an Ig C2 type domain, a fibronectin type III domain, and an intracellular postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95)/Discs large/zona occludens-1 (PDZ) binding domain, which is present on all members except SALM4 and SALM5 (Ko et al. 2006, Wang et al.2006, Morimura et al. 2006).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4055	E3 ubiquitin ligases ubiquitinate target proteins		E3 ubiquitin ligases catalyze the transfer of an ubiquitin from an E2-ubiquitin conjugate to a target protein. Generally, ubiquitin is transferred via formation of an amide bond to a particular lysine residue of the target protein, but ubiquitylation of cysteine, serine and threonine residues in a few targeted proteins has also been demonstrated (reviewed in McDowell and Philpott 2013, Berndsen and Wolberger 2014). Based on protein homologies, families of E3 ubiquitin ligases have been identified that include RING-type ligases (reviewed in Deshaies et al. 2009, Metzger et al. 2012, Metzger et al. 2014), HECT-type ligases (reviewed in Rotin et al. 2009, Metzger et al. 2012), and RBR-type ligases (reviewed in Dove et al. 2016). A subset of the RING-type ligases participate in CULLIN-RING ligase complexes (CRLs which include SCF complexes, reviewed in Lee and Zhou 2007, Genschik et al. 2013, Skaar et al. 2013, Lee et al. 2014).<br>Some E3-E2 combinations catalyze mono-ubiquitination of the target protein (reviewed in Nakagawa and Nakayama 2015). Other E3-E2 combinations catalyze conjugation of further ubiquitin monomers to the initial ubiquitin, forming polyubiquitin chains. (It may also be possible for some E3-E2 combinations to preassemble polyubiquitin and transfer it as a unit to the target protein.) Ubiquitin contains several lysine (K) residues and a free alpha amino group  to which further ubiquitin can be conjugated. Thus different types of polyubiquitin are possible: K11 linked polyubiquitin is observed in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), K29 linked polyubiquitin is observed in lysosomal degradation, K48 linked polyubiquitin directs target proteins to the proteasome for degradation, whereas K63 linked polyubiquitin generally acts as a scaffold to recruit other proteins in several cellular processes, notably DNA repair (reviewed in Komander et al. 2009).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4058	HSP90 chaperone cycle for steroid hormone receptors (SHR)		Steroid hormone receptors (SHR) are transcription factors that become activated upon sensing steroid hormones such as glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, progesterone, androgens, or estrogen (Escriva et al 2000; Griekspoor A et al. 2007; Eick GN & Thornton JW. 2011). Depending on SHR type and the presence of ligand, they show different subcellular localizations. Whereas both unliganded and liganded estrogen receptors (ERalpha and ERbeta) are predominantly nuclear, unliganded glucocorticoid (GR) and androgen receptors (AR) are mostly located in the cytoplasm and completely translocate to the nucleus only after binding hormone (Htun H et al. 1999; Stenoien D et al. 2000; Tyagi RK et al. 2000; Cadepond F et al. 1992; Jewell CM et al. 1995; Kumar S et al. 2006). The unliganded mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is partially cytoplasmic but can be found in nucleus in the ligand-bound or ligand-free form (Nishi M & Kawata M 2007). The progesterone receptor (PR) exists in two forms (PRA and PRB) with different ratios of nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization of the unliganded receptor. In most cell contexts, the PRA isoform is a repressor of the shorter PRB isoform, and without hormone induction it is mostly located in the nucleus, whereas PRB distributes both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (Lim CS et al. 1999; Griekspoor A et al. 2007). In the absence of ligand, members of the steroid receptor family remain sequestered in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus in the complex with proteins of HSP70/HSP90 chaperone machinery (Pratt WB & Dittmar KD1998). The highly dynamic ATP-dependent interactions of SHRs with HSP90 complexes regulate SHR cellular location, protein stability, competency to bind steroid hormones and transcriptional activity (Echeverria PC & Picard D 2010). Understanding the mechanism of ATPase activity of HSP90 is mostly based on structural and functional studies of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp90 complexes (Meyer P et al. 2003, 2004; Ali MM et al. 2006; Prodromou C et al. 2000; Prodromou C 2012). The ATPase cycle of human HSP90 is less well understood, however several studies suggest that the underlying enzymatic mechanisms and a set of conformational changes that accompany the ATPase cycle are highly similar in both species (Richter K et al. 2008; Vaughan CK et al. 2009). Nascent SHR proteins are chaperoned by HSP70 and HSP40 to HSP90 cycle via STIP1 (HOP) (and its TPR domains) (HernÃ¡ndez MP et al. 2002a,b; EcheverriaPC & Picard D 2010; Li J et al. 2011). The ATP-bound form of HSP90 leads to the displacement of STIP1 by immunophilins FKBP5 or FKBP4 resulting in conformational changes that allow efficient hormone binding (Li J et al. 2011). PTGES3 (p23) binds to HSP90 complex finally stabilizing it in the conformation with a high hormone binding affinity. After hydrolysis of ATP the hormone bound SHR is released from HSP90 complex. The cytosolic hormone-bound SHR can be transported to the nucleus by several import pathways such as the dynein-based nuclear transport along microtubules involving the transport of the entire HSP90 complex or nuclear localization signals (NLS)-mediated nuclear targeting by importins (Tyagi RK et al. 2000; Cadepond F et al. 1992; Jewell CM et al. 1995; Kumar S et al. 2006). It is worth noting that GR-importin interactions can be ligand-dependent or independent (Freedman & Yamamoto 2004; Picard & Yamamoto 1987). In the nucleus ligand-activated SHR dimerizes, binds specific sequences in the DNA, called Hormone Responsive Elements (HRE), and recruits a number of coregulators that facilitate gene transcription. Nuclear localization is essential for SHRs to transactivate their target genes, but the same receptors also possess non-genomic functions in the cytoplasm.<p>The Reactome module describes the ATPase-driven conformational cycle of HSP90 that regulates ligand-dependent activation of SHRs.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4059	Interconversion of nucleotide di- and triphosphates		An array of kinases catalyze the reversible phosphorylation of nucleotide monophosphates to form nucleotide diphosphates and triphosphates.<p>Nucleoside monophosphate kinases catalyze the reversible phosphorylation of nucleoside and deoxynucleoside 5'-monophosphates to form the corresponding nucleoside 5'-diphosphates.  Most appear to have restricted specificities for nucleoside monophosphates, and to use ATP preferentially (Van Rompay et al. 2000; Anderson 1973; Noda 1973).  The total number of human enzymes that catalyze these reactions in vivo is not clear.  In six cases, a well-defined biochemical activity has been associated with a purified protein, and these are annotated here.  However, additional nucleoside monophosphate kinase-like human proteins have been identified in molecular cloning studies whose enzymatic activities are unknown, and several distinctive nucleoside monophosphate kinase activities detected in cell extracts, e.g., a GTP-requiring adenylate kinase activity (Wilson et al. 1976) and one or more guanylate kinase activities (Jamil et al. 1975) have not been unambiguously associated with specific human proteins.<P>The nucleoside monophosphates against which each of the six well-characterized enzymes is active is shown in the table (Van Rompay et al. 2000).  All six efficiently use ATP as a phosphate donor, but have some activity with other nucleoside triphosphates as well in vitro.  The high concentrations of ATP relative to other nucleoside triphosphates in vivo makes it the likely major phosphate donor in these reactions under most conditions.<P>All of these phosphorylation reactions are freely reversible in vitro when carried out with purified enzymes and substrates, having equilibrium constants near 1.  In vivo, high ratios of ATP to ADP are likely to favor the forward direction of these reactions, i.e., the conversion of (d)NMP and ATP to (d)NDP and ADP.  At the same time, the reversibility of the reactions and the overlapping substrate specificities of the enzymes raises the possibility that this group of reactions can buffer the intracellular nucleotide pool and regulate the relative concentrations of individual nucleotides in the pool: if any one molecule builds up to unusually high levels, multiple routes appear to be open not only to dispose of it but to use it to increase the supply of less abundant nucleotides.<p>Ribonucleotide reductase catalyzes the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotide diphosphates from ribonucleotide diphosphates.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4063	Interleukin-10 signaling		Interleukin-10 (IL10) was originally described as a factor named cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor that  inhibited T-helper (Th) 1 activation and Th1 cytokine production (Fiorentino et al. 1989). It was found to be expressed by a variety of cell types including macrophages, dendritic cell subsets, B cells, several T-cell subpopulations including Th2 and T-regulatory cells (Tregs) and Natural Killer (NK) cells (Moore et al. 2001). It is now recognized that the biological effects of IL10 are directed at antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), its effects on T-cell development and differentiation are largely indirect via inhibition of macrophage/dendritic cell activation and maturation (Pestka et al. 2004, Mocellin et al. 2004). T cells are thought to be the main source of IL10 (Hedrich & Bream 2010). IL10 inhibits a broad spectrum of activated macrophage/monocyte functions including monokine synthesis, NO production, and expression of class II MHC and costimulatory molecules such as IL12 and CD80/CD86 (de Waal Malefyt et al. 1991, Gazzinelli et al. 1992). Studies with recombinant cytokine and neutralizing antibodies revealed pleiotropic activities of IL10 on B, T, and mast cells (de Waal Malefyt et al. 1993, Rousset et al. 1992, Thompson-Snipes et al. 1991) and provided evidence for the in vivo significance of IL10 activities (Ishida et al. 1992, 1993). IL10 antagonizes the expression of MHC class II and the co-stimulatory molecules CD80/CD86 as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1Beta, IL6, IL8, TNFalpha and especially IL12 (Fiorentino et al. 1991, D'Andrea et al. 1993). The biological role of IL10 is not limited to inactivation of APCs, it also enhances B cell, granulocyte, mast cell, and keratinocyte growth/differentiation, as well as NK-cell and CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell activation (Moore et al. 2001, Hedrich & Bream 2010). IL10 also enhances NK-cell proliferation and/or production of IFN-gamma (Cai et al. 1999).  <br><br>IL10-deficient mice exhibited inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and other exaggerated inflammatory responses (Kuhn et al. 1993, Berg et al. 1995) indicating a critical role for IL10 in limiting inflammatory responses. Dysregulation of IL10 is linked with susceptibility to numerous infectious and autoimmune diseases in humans and mouse models (Hedrich & Bream 2010). <br><br>IL10 signaling is initiated by binding of homodimeric IL10 to the extracellular domains of two adjoining IL10RA molecules. This tetramer then binds two IL10RB chains. IL10RB cannot bind to IL10 unless bound to IL10RA (Ding et al. 2001, Yoon et al. 2006); binding of IL10 to IL10RA without the co-presence of IL10RB fails to initiate signal transduction (Kotenko et al. 1997).<br><br>IL10 binding activates the receptor-associated Janus tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and TYK2, which are constitutively bound to IL10R1 and IL10R2 respectively. In the classic model of receptor activation assembly of the receptor complex is believed to enable JAK1/TYK2 to phosphorylate and activate each other. Alternatively the binding of IL10 may cause conformational changes that allow the pseudokinase inhibitory domain of one JAK kinase to move away from the kinase domain of the other JAK within the receptor dimer-JAK complex, allowing the two kinase domains to interact and trans-activate (Waters & Brooks 2015).<br><br>The activated JAK kinases phosphorylate the intracellular domains of the IL10R1 chains on specific tyrosine residues. These phosphorylated tyrosine residues and their flanking peptide sequences serve as temporary docking sites for the latent, cytosolic, transcription factor, STAT3. STAT3 transiently docks on the IL10R1 chain via its SH2 domain, and is in turn tyrosine phosphorylated by the receptor-associated JAKs. Once activated, it dissociates from the receptor, dimerizes with other STAT3 molecules, and translocates to the nucleus where it binds with high affinity to STAT-binding elements (SBEs) in the promoters of IL-10-inducible genes (Donnelly et al. 1999).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4064	Intracellular oxygen transport		Globins are heme-containing proteins that reversibly bind molecular oxygen.  Humans contain at least 5 types of globins: hemoglobins, myoglobin, cytoglobin, neuroglobin, and androglobin (reviewed in Burmester et al. 2014). Myoglobin, neuroglobin, and cytoglobin are cytosolic globins with similar affinities for oxygen (reviewed in Hankeln et al. 2005). Androglobin is a more distantly related globin of uncertain function that is expressed in testes (Hoogewijs et al. 2012). Myoglobin is predominantly expressed in muscle tissue (reviewed in Helbo et al. 2013), neuroglobin is expressed in neurons, and cytoglobin is expressed in connective tissue fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (reviewed in Pesce et al. 2002, Hankeln et al. 2004, Ascenzi et al. 2016). Whereas myoglobin contains pentacoordinated heme iron, neuroglobin and cytoglobin contain hexacoordinated heme iron: the iron atom is bound by 4 nitrogen atoms of heme and 2 histidine residues of the globin. Binding by one of the histidines is reversible, which allows the iron atom to bind various ligands such as molecular oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide (reviewed in Kakar et al. 2010). Neuroglobin may function in oxygen homeostasis, however the importance of its oxygen-binding activity is unclear (reviewed in Pesce et al. 2002, Hankeln et al. 2005). Cytoglobin may function in nitric oxide metabolism (Thuy et al. 2016, Liu et al. 2017). Globins can also regulate oxygen homeostasis via reactions with nitric oxide (NO), a vasodilator. Oxygenated globins scavenge NO by oxidation while deoxygenated globins can act as a nitrite reductase to produce NO (reviewed in Hendgen-Cotta et al. 2014, Tejero and Gladwin 2014).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4065	Clathrin-mediated endocytosis		Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is one of a number of process that control the uptake of material from the plasma membrane, and leads to the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (Pearse et al, 1975; reviewed in Robinson, 2015; McMahon and Boucrot, 2011; Kirchhausen et al, 2014).  CME contributes to signal transduction by regulating the cell surface expression and signaling of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).  Most RTKs exhibit a robust increase in internalization rate after binding specific ligands; however, some RTKs may also exhibit significant ligand-independent internalization (reviewed in Goh and Sorkin, 2013). CME controls RTK and GPCR signaling by organizing signaling both within the plasma membrane and on endosomes (reviewed in Eichel et al, 2016; Garay et al, 2015; Vieira et al, 1996; Sorkin and von Zastrow, 2014; Di Fiori and von Zastrow, 2014; Barbieri et al, 2016). CME also contributes to the uptake of material such as metabolites, hormones and other proteins from the extracellular space, and regulates membrane composition by recycling membrane components and/or targeting them for degradation. <br><br><br>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis involves initiation of clathrin-coated pit (CCP) formation, cargo selection, coat assembly and stabilization, membrane scission and vesicle uncoating.  Although for simplicity in this pathway, the steps leading to a mature CCP are represented in a linear and temporally distinct fashion, the formation of a clathrin-coated vesicle is a highly heterogeneous process and clear temporal boundaries between these processes may not exist (see for instance Taylor et al, 2011; Antonescu et al, 2011; reviewed in Kirchhausen et al, 2014). Cargo selection in particular is a critical aspect of the formation of a mature and stable CCP, and many of the proteins involved in the initiation and maturation of a CCP contribute to cargo selection and are themselves stabilized upon incorporation of cargo into the nascent vesicle (reviewed in Kirchhausen et al, 2014; McMahon and Boucrot, 2011).<br><br><br><br>Although the clathrin triskelion was identified early as a major component of the coated vesicles, clathrin does not bind directly to membranes or to the endocytosed cargo.  Vesicle formation instead relies on many proteins and adaptors that can bind the plasma membrane and interact with cargo molecules. Cargo selection depends on the recognition of endocytic signals in cytoplasmic tails of the cargo proteins by adaptors that interact with components of the vesicle's inner coat.  The classic adaptor for clathrin-coated vesicles is the tetrameric AP-2 complex, which along with clathrin was identified early as a major component of the coat.  Some cargo indeed bind directly to AP-2, but subsequent work has revealed a large family of proteins collectively known as CLASPs (clathrin- associated sorting proteins) that mediate the recruitment of diverse cargo into the emerging clathrin-coated vesicles (reviewed in Traub and Bonifacino, 2013).  Many of these CLASP proteins themselves interact with AP-2 and clathrin, coordinating cargo recruitment with coat formation (Schmid et al, 2006; Edeling et al, 2006; reviewed in Traub and Bonifacino, 2013; Kirchhausen et al, 2014).  <br><br><br>Initiation of CCP formation is also influenced by lipid composition, regulated by clathrin-associated phosphatases and kinases (reviewed in Picas et al, 2016). The plasma membrane is enriched in PI(4,5)P2.  Many of the proteins involved in initiating clathrin-coated pit formation bind to PI(4,5)P2 and induce membrane curvature through their BAR domains (reviewed in McMahon and Boucrot, 2011; Daumke et al, 2014).  Epsin also contributes to early membrane curvature through its Epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain, which promotes membrane curvature by inserting into the lipid bilayer (Ford et al, 2002). <br><br>Following initiation, some CCPs progress to formation of vesicles, while others undergo disassembly at the cell surface without producing vesicles (Ehrlich et al, 2004; Loerke et al, 2009; Loerke et al, 2011; Aguet et al, 2013; Taylor et al, 2011). The assembly and stabilization of nascent CCPs is regulated by several proteins and lipids (Mettlen et al, 2009; Antonescu et al, 2011).<br><br><br>Maturation of the emerging clathrin-coated vesicle is accompanied by further changes in the lipid composition of the membrane and increased membrane curvature, promoted by the recruitment of N-BAR domain containing proteins (reviewed in Daumke et al, 2014; Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012; Picas et al, 2016). Some N-BAR domain containing proteins also contribute to the recruitment of the large GTPase dynamin, which is responsible for scission of the mature vesicle from the plasma membrane (Koh et al, 2007; Lundmark and Carlsson, 2003; Soulet et al, 2005; David et al, 1996; Owen et al, 1998; Shupliakov et al, 1997; Taylor et al, 2011; Ferguson et al, 2009; Aguet et al, 2013; Posor et al, 2013; Chappie et al, 2010; Shnyrova et al, 2013; reviewed in Mettlen et al, 2009; Daumke et al, 2014).  After vesicle scission, the clathrin coat is dissociated from the new vesicle by the ATPase HSPA8 (also known as HSC70) and its DNAJ cofactor auxilin, priming the vesicle for fusion with a subsequent endocytic compartment and releasing clathrin for reuse  (reviewed in McMahon and Boucrot, 2011; Sousa and Laufer, 2015).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4066	Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-13 signaling		Interleukin-4 (IL4) is a principal regulatory cytokine during the immune response, crucially important in allergy and asthma (Nelms et al. 1999). When resting T cells are antigen-activated and expand in response to Interleukin-2 (IL2), they can differentiate as Type 1 (Th1) or Type 2 (Th2) T helper cells. The outcome is influenced by IL4. Th2 cells secrete IL4, which both stimulates Th2 in an autocrine fashion and acts as a potent B cell growth factor to promote humoral immunity (Nelms et al. 1999). <br><br>Interleukin-13 (IL13) is an immunoregulatory cytokine secreted predominantly by activated Th2 cells. It is a key mediator in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation. IL13 shares many functional properties with IL4, stemming from the fact that they share a common receptor subunit. IL13 receptors are expressed on human B cells, basophils, eosinophils, mast cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, monocytes, macrophages, respiratory epithelial cells, and smooth muscle cells, but unlike IL4, not T cells. Thus IL13 does not appear to be important in the initial differentiation of CD4 T cells into Th2 cells, rather it is important in the effector phase of allergic inflammation (Hershey et al. 2003).IL4 and IL13 induce â€œalternative activationâ€� of macrophages, inducing an anti-inflammatory phenotype by signaling through IL4R alpha in a STAT6 dependent manner. This signaling plays an important role in the Th2 response, mediating anti-parasitic effects and aiding wound healing (Gordon & Martinez 2010, Loke et al. 2002)There are two types of IL4 receptor complex (Andrews et al. 2006). Type I IL4R (IL4R1) is predominantly expressed on the surface of hematopoietic cells and consists of IL4R and IL2RG, the common gamma chain. Type II IL4R (IL4R2) is predominantly expressed on the surface of nonhematopoietic cells, it consists of IL4R and IL13RA1 and is also the type II receptor for IL13. (Obiri et al. 1995, Aman et al. 1996, Hilton et al. 1996, Miloux et al. 1997, Zhang et al. 1997). The second receptor for IL13 consists of IL4R and Interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13RA2), sometimes called Interleukin-13 binding protein (IL13BP). It has a high affinity receptor for IL13 (Kd = 250 pmol/L) but is not sufficient to render cells responsive to IL13, even in the presence of IL4R (Donaldson et al. 1998). It is reported to exist in soluble form (Zhang et al. 1997) and when overexpressed reduces JAK-STAT signaling (Kawakami et al. 2001). It's function may be to prevent IL13 signalling via the functional IL4R:IL13RA1 receptor. IL13RA2 is overexpressed and enhances cell invasion in some human cancers (Joshi & Puri 2012).<br><br>The first step in the formation of IL4R1 (IL4:IL4R:IL2RB) is the binding of IL4 with IL4R (Hoffman et al. 1995, Shen et al. 1996, Hage et al. 1999). This is also the first step in formation of IL4R2 (IL4:IL4R:IL13RA1). After the initial binding of IL4 and IL4R, IL2RB binds (LaPorte et al. 2008), to form IL4R1. Alternatively, IL13RA1 binds, forming IL4R2. In contrast, the type II IL13 complex (IL13R2) forms with IL13 first binding to IL13RA1 followed by recruitment of  IL4R (Wang et al. 2009).<br><br>Crystal structures of the IL4:IL4R:IL2RG, IL4:IL4R:IL13RA1 and IL13:IL4R:IL13RA1 complexes have been determined (LaPorte et al. 2008). Consistent with these structures, in monocytes IL4R is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to both IL4 and IL13 (Roy et al. 2002, Gordon & Martinez 2010) while IL13RA1 phosphorylation is induced only by IL13 (Roy et al. 2002, LaPorte et al. 2008) and IL2RG phosphorylation is induced only by IL4 (Roy et al. 2002).<br><br>Both IL4 receptor complexes signal through Jak/STAT cascades. IL4R is constitutively-associated with JAK2 (Roy et al. 2002) and associates with JAK1 following binding of IL4 (Yin et al. 1994) or IL13 (Roy et al. 2002). IL2RG constitutively associates with JAK3 (Boussiotis et al. 1994, Russell  et al. 1994). IL13RA1 constitutively associates with TYK2 (Umeshita-Suyama et al. 2000, Roy et al. 2002, LaPorte et al. 2008, Bhattacharjee et al. 2013). <br><br>IL4 binding to IL4R1 leads to phosphorylation of JAK1 (but not JAK2) and STAT6 activation (Takeda et al. 1994, Ratthe et al. 2007, Bhattacharjee et al. 2013). <br><br>IL13 binding increases activating tyrosine-99 phosphorylation of IL13RA1 but not that of IL2RG. IL4 binding to IL2RG leads to its tyrosine phosphorylation (Roy et al. 2002). IL13 binding to IL4R2 leads to TYK2 and JAK2 (but not JAK1) phosphorylation (Roy & Cathcart 1998, Roy et al. 2002).<br><br>Phosphorylated TYK2 binds and phosphorylates STAT6 and possibly STAT1 (Bhattacharjee et al. 2013).  <br><br>A second mechanism of signal transduction activated by IL4 and IL13 leads to the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) family (Kelly-Welch et al. 2003). IL4R1 associates with insulin receptor substrate 2 and activates the PI3K/Akt and Ras/MEK/Erk pathways involved in cell proliferation, survival and translational control. IL4R2 does not associate with insulin receptor substrate 2 and consequently the PI3K/Akt and Ras/MEK/Erk pathways are not activated (Busch-Dienstfertig & GonzÃ¡lez-RodrÃ­guez 2013).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4069	Regulation of TLR by endogenous ligand		Diverse molecules of host-cell origin may serve as endogenous ligands of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Erridge C 2010; Piccinini AM & Midwood KS 2010). These molecules are known as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). DAMPs are immunologically silent in healthy tissues but become active upon tissue damage during both infectious and sterile insult. DAMPs are released from necrotic cells or secreted from activated cells in response to tissue damage to mediate tissue repair by promoting inflammatory responses. However, DAMPs have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), cancer, and atherosclerosis. The mechanism underlying the switch from DAMPs that initiate controlled tissue repair, to those that mediate chronic, uncontrolled inflammation is still unclear. Recent evidence suggests that an abnormal increase in protein citrullination is  involved in disease pathophysiology (Anzilotti C et al. 2010; Sanchez-Pernaute O et al. 2013; Sokolove J et al. 2011; Sharma P et al. 2012). Citrullination is a post-translational modification event mediated by peptidyl-arginine deaminase enzymes which catalyze the deimination of proteins by converting arginine residues into citrullines in the presence of calcium ions.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4070	RAB GEFs exchange GTP for GDP on RABs		Human cells have more than 60 RAB proteins that are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking. These small GTPases contribute to trafficking specificity by localizing to the membranes of different organelles and interacting with effectors such as sorting adaptors, tethering factors, kinases, phosphatases and tubular-vesicular cargo (reviewed in Stenmark et al, 2009; Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014; Zhen and Stenmark, 2015). <br><br>RAB localization depends on a number of factors including C-terminal prenylation, the sequence of upstream hypervariable regions and what nucleotide is bound, as well as interaction with RAB-interacting proteins (Chavrier et al, 1991; Ullrich et al, 1993; Soldati et al, 1994; Farnsworth et al, 1994; Seabra, 1996; Wu et al, 2010; reviewed in Stenmark, 2009; Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014).  More recently, the activity of RAB GEFs has also been implicated in regulating the localization of RAB proteins (Blumer et al, 2103; Schoebel et al, 2009; Cabrera and Ungermann, 2013; reviewed in Barr, 2013; Zhen and Stenmark, 2015)<br><br>In the active, GTP-bound form, RAB proteins are membrane-associated, while in the inactive GDP-bound form, RABs are extracted from the target membrane and exist in a soluble form in complex with GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) (Ullrich et al, 1993; Soldati et al, 1994; Gavriljuk et al, 2013). Conversion between the inactive and active form relies on the activities of RAB guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) (Yoshimura et al, 2010; Wu et al, 2011; Pan et al, 2006; Frasa et al, 2012; reviewed in Stenmark, 2009; Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014; Ishida et al, 2016).<br><br>Newly synthesized RABs are bound to a RAB escort protein, CHM (also known as REP1) or CHML (REP2) (Alexandrov et al, 1994; Shen and Seabra, 1996). CHM/REP proteins are the substrate-binding component of the trimeric RAB geranylgeranyltransferase enzyme (GGTaseII) along with the two catalytic subunits RABGGTA and RABGGTB (reviewed in Gutkowska and Swiezewska, 2012; Palsuledesai and Distefano, 2015). REP proteins recruit the unmodified RAB in its GDP-bound state to the GGTase for sequential geranylgeranylation at one or two C-terminal cysteine residues (Alexandrov et al, 1994; Seabra et al 1996; Shen and Seabra, 1996; Baron and Seabra, 2008). After geranylation, CHM/REP proteins remain in complex with the geranylated RAB and escort it to its target membrane, where RAB activity is regulated by GAPs, GEFs, GDIs and membrane-bound GDI displacement factors (GDFs) (Sivars et al, 2003; reviewed in Stenmark, 2009; Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014).<br><br>Unlike the RAB GAPS, which (to date) all contain a shared TBC domain, RAB GEFs are structurally diverse and range from monomeric to multisubunit complexes (reviewed in Fukuda et al, 2011; Frasa et al, 2012; Cherfils and Zeghouf, 2013; Ishida et al, 2016).  While many GEFs contain one of three conserved GEF domains identified to date  - the DENN (differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cell) domain, the VPS9 domain and the SEC2 domain- other GEFs lack a conserved domain (reviewed in Ishida et al, 2016). Based on sequence conservation and subunit organization, GEFs can be grouped into 6 general classes: the DENND-containing GEFs, the VPS9-containing GEFs (both monomeric), the SEC2-containing GEFs (homodimeric), heterodimeric GEF complexes such as RIC1:RGP1, the multisubunit TRAPPC GEF, and others (reviewed in Barr and Lambright, 2010; Marat et al, 2011; Ishida et al, 2016). GEFs for many RABs have still not been identified, however. View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=8876198 Reactome].		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4072	Glycogen metabolism		Glycogen, a highly branched glucose polymer, is formed and broken down in most human tissues, but is most abundant in liver and muscle, where it serves as a major stored fuel. Glycogen metabolism has been studied in most detail in liver and skeletal muscle. Glycogen metabolism in other tissues has not been studied as extensively, and is thought to resemble the muscle process.<br>Glycogen synthesis involves five reactions. The first two, conversion of glucose 6-phosphate to glucose 1-phosphate and synthesis of UDP-glucose from glucose 1-phosphate and UTP, are shared with several other pathways. The next three reactions, the auto-catalyzed synthesis of a glucose oligomer on glycogenin, the linear extension of the glucose oligomer catalyzed by glycogen synthase, and the formation of branches catalyzed by glycogen branching enzyme, are unique to glycogen synthesis. Repetition of the last two reactions generates large, extensively branched glycogen polymers. The catalysis of glycogenin glucosylation and oligoglucose chain extension by distinct isozymes in liver and nonhepatic tissues allows them to be regulated independently (Agius 2008; Bollen et al. 1998; Roach et al. 2012).<br>Cytosolic glycogen breakdown occurs via the same chemical steps in all tissues but is separately regulated via tissue specific isozymes and signaling pathways that enable distinct physiological fates for glycogen in liver and other tissues. Glycogen phosphorylase, which can be activated by phosphorylase kinase, catalyzes the removal of glucose residues as glucose 1-phosphate from the ends of glycogen branches. The final four residues of each branch are removed in two steps catalyzed by debranching enzyme, and further glycogen phosphorylase activity completes the process of glycogen breakdown. The first glucose residue in each branch is released as free glucose; all other residues are released as glucose 1-phosphate. The latter molecule can be converted to glucose 6-phosphate in a step shared with other pathways (Villar-Palasi & Larner 1970; Hers 1976).<br>Glycogen can also be taken up into lysosomes, where it is normally broken done by the action of a single enzyme, lysosomal alpha-glucosidase (GAA) (Brown et al. 1970).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4074	RNA Polymerase I Transcription		RNA polymerase (Pol) I (one of three eukaryotic nuclear RNA polymerases) is devoted to the transcription of the ribosomal DNA genes, which are found in multiple arrayed copies in every eukaryotic cell. These genes encode for the large ribosomal RNA precursor, which is then processed into the three largest subunits of the ribosomal RNA, the 18S, 28S, and 5.8S RNAs. In human cells the rDNA gene clusters are localized on the short arm of the five pairs of the acrocentric chromosomes.  The rRNA promoter has two essential and specially spaced sequences: a CORE element and an upstream control element (UCE, also called UPE). The CORE element of the human promoter overlaps with the transcription start site, extending from 20 to 45, and is required for specific initiation of transcription. <br>The polymerase is a multisubunit complex, composed of two large subunits (the most conserved portions include the catalytic site that shares similarity with other eukaryotic and bacterial multisubunit RNA polymerases) and a number of smaller subunits. Under a number of experimental conditions the core is competent to mediate ribonucleic acid synthesis, in vivo however, it requires additional factors to select the appropriate template. In humans the RNA transcript (45S) is approximately 13,000 nucleotides long. Before leaving the nucleus as assembled ribosomal particles, the 45S rRNA is cleaved to give one copy each of the 28S rRNA, the 18S rRNA, and the 5.8S rRNA. Equal quantities of the three rRNAs are produced by initially transcribing them as one transcript. View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=73864 Reactome].		9606

These tails vary in sequence between tubulin isoforms and are exposed on the surfaces of microtubules. They can undergo a variety of posttranslational modifications, including the attachment and removal of polyglutamate chains and in the case of alpha-tunulins the loss and reattachment of a terminal tyrosine (Tyr) residue. These modifications are associated with changes in the rigidity and stability of microtubules (Song & Brady 2015; Yu et al. 2015).<br>Mutations affecting these modification processes can have severe effects on phenotype (e.g., Ikegami et al. 2007). Nevertheless, the precise molecular mechanisms by which these changes in tubulin structure modulate its functions remain unclear, so these modification processes are simply annotated here as a series of chemical transformations of tubulins.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4079	RUNX1 and FOXP3 control the development of regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs)		The complex of CBFB and RUNX1 (AML1) controls transcription of the FOXP3 gene. FOXP3 is a transcription factor that acts as a key regulator of development and function of regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs). Tregs are CD25+CD4+ T lymphocytes involved in suppression of aberrant immune responses seen in autoimmune diseases and allergies. FOXP3 can bind to RUNX1 and control transcriptional activity of the RUNX1:CBFB complex. RUNX1 stimulates transcription of IL2 and IFNG1 (IFN-gamma), and the expression of these two genes is repressed upon binding of FOXP3 to RUNX1. The complex of FOXP3 and RUNX1, on the other hand, stimulates transcription of cell surface markers of Tregs, such as CD25, CTLA-4 and GITR. In the absence of FOXP3, RUNX1 represses transcription of these genes (Shevach 2000, Maloy and Powrie 2001, Sakaguchi 2004, Ono et al. 2007, Kitoh et al. 2009).<br>The RUNX1:CBFB complex directly stimulates transcription of the CR1 gene, encoding Complement receptor type 1 (CD35) (Kim et al. 1999, Rho et al. 2002). Expression of CR1 on the surface of activated T cells contributes to generation of Tregs (Torok et al. 2015).

Disturbances in the normal redox state of tissues can cause toxic effects through the production of peroxides and free radicals that damage all components of the cell, including proteins, lipids, and DNA. Some reactive oxidative species can even act as messengers through a phenomenon called redox signaling.In humans, oxidative stress is involved in many diseases. Examples include Sickle Cell Disease,[1] atherosclerosis, Parkinson's disease, heart failure, myocardial infarction, Alzheimer's disease, Schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder, fragile X syndrome[2] and chronic fatigue syndrome, but short-term oxidative stress may also be important in prevention of aging by induction of a process named mitohormesis.[3] Reactive oxygen species can be beneficial, as they are used by the immune system as a way to attack and kill pathogens.Source: Wikipedia ([[wikipedia:Oxidative_stress]])Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP408 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606

Although several of the individual reactions in this sequence are reversible, as indicated by the double-headed arrows in the diagram, other irreversible steps drive the pathway in the direction of IMP synthesis in the normal cell.  All of these reactions are thus annotated here only in the direction of IMP synthesis.  Guanosine 5'-monophosphate (GMP) and adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) are synthesized from IMP (Zalkin & Dixon 1992).<p>The pyrimidine orotate (orotic acid) is synthesized in a sequence of four reactions, deriving its atoms from glutamine, bicarbonate, and aspartate. A single multifunctional cytosolic enzyme catalyzes the first three of these reactions, while the last one is catalyzed by an enzyme associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane. In two further reactions, catalyzed by a bifunctional cytosolic enzyme, orotate reacts with 1-phosphoribosyl 5-pyrophosphate (PRPP) to yield orotidine 5'-monophosphate, which is decarboxylated to yield uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP). While several individual reactions in this pathway are reversible, other irreversible reactions drive the pathway in the direction of UMP biosynthesis in the normal cell. All reactions are thus annotated here only in the forward direction.<p>This pathway has been most extensively analyzed at the genetic and biochemical level in hamster cell lines. All three enzymes have also been purified from human sources, however, and the key features of these reactions have been confirmed from studies of this human material (Jones 1980).<p>All other pyrimidines are synthesized from UMP.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4085	Phase I - Functionalization of compounds		Phase 1 of metabolism is concerned with <i><b>functionalization</b></i>, that is the introduction or exposure of functional groups on the chemical structure of a compound. This provides a 'handle' for phase 2 conjugating species with which to react with. Many xenobiotics are lipophilic and almost chemically inert (e.g. PAHs) so would not necessarily undergo a phase 2 reaction. Making them more chemically reactive would facilitate their excretion but also increases their chance of reacting with cellular macromolecules (e.g. proteins, DNA). There is a fine balance between producing a more reactive metabolite and conjugation reactions.<br>There are two groups of enzymes in phase 1 - oxidoreductases and hydrolases. Oxidoreductases introduce an oxygen atom into or remove electrons from their substrates. The major oxidoreductase enzyme system is called the P450 monooxygenases. Other systems include flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO), cyclooxygenases (COX) and monoamine oxidases (MAO). Hydrolases hydrolyse esters, amides, epoxides and glucuronides.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4086	Transcriptional regulation by the AP-2 (TFAP2) family of transcription factors		The AP-2 (TFAP2) family of transcription factors includes five proteins in mammals: TFAP2A (AP-2 alpha), TFAP2B (AP-2 beta), TFAP2C (AP-2 gamma), TFAP2D (AP-2 delta) and TFAP2E (AP-2 epsilon). The AP-2 family transcription factors are evolutionarily conserved in metazoans and are characterized by a helix-span-helix motif at the C-terminus, a central basic region, and the transactivation domain at the N-terminus. The helix-span-helix motif and the basic region enable dimerization and DNA binding (Eckert et al. 2005).<p>AP-2 dimers bind palindromic GC-rich DNA response elements that match the consensus sequence 5'-GCCNNNGGC-3' (Williams and Tjian 1991a, Williams and Tjian 1991b). Transcriptional co-factors from the CITED family interact with the helix-span-helix (HSH) domain of TFAP2 (AP-2) family of transcription factors and recruit transcription co-activators EP300 (p300) and CREBBP (CBP) to TFAP2-bound DNA elements. CITED2 shows the highest affinity for TFAP2 proteins, followed by CITED4, while CITED1 interacts with TFAP2s with a very low affinity. Mouse embryos defective for CITED2 exhibit neural crest defects, cardiac malformations and adrenal agenesis, which can at least in part be attributed to a defective Tfap2 transactivation (Bamforth et al. 2001, Braganca et al. 2002, Braganca et al. 2003). Transcriptional activity of AP-2 dimers in inhibited by binding of KCTD1 or KCTD15 to the AP-2 transactivation domain (Ding et al. 2009, Zarelli and Dawid 2013). Transcriptional activity of TFAP2A, TFAP2B and TFAP2C is negatively regulated by SUMOylation mediated by UBE2I (UBC9) (Eloranta and Hurst 2002, Berlato et al. 2011, Impens et al. 2014, Bogachek et al. 2014).<p>During embryonic development, AP-2 transcription factors stimulate proliferation and suppress terminal differentiation in a cell-type specific manner (Eckert et al. 2005).<p>TFAP2A and TFAP2C directly stimulate transcription of the estrogen receptor ESR1 gene (McPherson and Weigel 1999). TFAP2A expression correlates with ESR1 expression in breast cancer, and TFAP2C is frequently overexpressed in estrogen-positive breast cancer and endometrial cancer (deConinck et al. 1995, Turner et al. 1998). TFAP2A, TFAP2C, as well as TFAP2B can directly stimulate the expression of ERBB2, another important breast cancer gene (Bosher et al. 1996). Association of TFAP2A with the YY1 transcription factor significantly increases the ERBB2 transcription rate (Begon et al. 2005). In addition to ERBB2, the expression of another receptor tyrosine kinase, KIT, is also stimulated by TFAP2A and TFAP2B (Huang et al. 1998), while the expression of the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase ligand VEGFA is repressed by TFAP2A (Ruiz et al. 2004, Li et al. 2012). TFAP2A stimulates transcription of the transforming growth factor alpha (TGFA) gene (Wang et al. 1997). TFAP2C regulates EGFR in luminal breast cancer (De Andrade et al. 2016).<p>TFAP2C plays a critical role in maintaining the luminal phenotype in human breast cancer and in influencing the luminal cell phenotype during normal mammary development (Cyr et al. 2015).<p>In placenta, TFAP2A and TFAP2C directly stimulate transcription of both subunits of the human chorionic gonadotropin, CGA and CGB (Johnson et al. 1997, LiCalsi et al. 2000).<p>TFAP2A and/or TFAP2C, in complex with CITED2, stimulate transcription of the PITX2 gene, involved in left-right patterning and heart development (Bamforth et al. 2004, Li et al. 2012).<p>TFAP2A and TFAP2C play opposing roles in transcriptional regulation of the CDKN1A (p21) gene locus. While TFAP2A stimulates transcription of the CDKN1A cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (Zeng et al. 1997, Williams et al. 2009, Scibetta et al. 2010), TFAP2C represses CDKN1A transcription (Williams et al. 2009, Scibetta et al. 2010, Wong et al. 2012). Transcription of the TFAP2A gene may be inhibited by CREB and E2F1 (Melnikova et al. 2010).<p>For review of the AP-2 family of transcription factors, please refer to Eckert et al. 2005.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4087	Keratinization		Keratins are the major structural protein of vertebrate epidermis, constituting up to 85% of a fully differentiated keratinocyte (Fuchs 1995). Keratins belong to a superfamily of intermediate filament (IF) proteins that form alpha-helical coiled-coil dimers, which associate laterally and end-to-end to form approximately 10 nm diameter filaments. Keratin filaments are heteropolymeric, formed from equal amounts of acidic type I and basic /neutral type 2 keratins. Humans have 54 keratin genes (Schweitzer et al. 2006). They have highly specific expression patterns, related to the epithelial type and stage of differentiation. Roughly half of human keratins are specific to hair follicles (Langbein & Schweizer 2005). Keratin filaments bundle into tonofilaments that span the cytoplasm and bind to desmosomes and other cell membrane structures (Waschke 2008). This reflects their primary function, maintaining the mechanical stability of individual cells and epithelial tissues (Moll et al. 2008).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4088	Mitochondrial calcium ion transport		Divalent calcium ions (Ca2+) are transported from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix and back out of the matrix into the cytosol (reviewed in Santo-Domingo et al. 2010, De Stefani et al. 2016). In the matrix, Ca2+ binds and allosterically regulates pyruvate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, and possibly other enzymes (Rizzuto et al. 2012). Matrix calcium is also observed to regulate release of caspase cofactors and calcium flux through channels on neighboring membranes, The pathway into the mitochondrion involves VDAC1, VDAC2, and VDAC3 in the outer membrane and the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex in the inner membrane. VDACs in the open conformation are anion channels. However in the closed conformation they transport Ca2+ from the cytosol to the intermembrane space. When calcium concentrations in the cytosol and intermembrane space are high, the MCU complex opens and transports Ca2+ from the intermembrane space to the mitochondrial matrix using the driving force of the membrane potential (reviewed in Drago et al. 2011, Marchi et al. 2014, De Stefani et al. 2015).<br>Efflux of Ca2+ from the matrix to the intermembrane space is catalyzed by the Na+/Ca2+ antiporter SLC8B1 (NCLX) located in the inner membrane. LETM1 is also observed to export calcium from the matrix to the intermembrane space by acting as an H+/Ca2+ antiporter, although somewhat contradictory results have been found in knockdowns of LETM1. Calcium in the intermembrane space may be transported to the cytosol by the Na+/Ca2+ antiporter SLC8A3 (NCX3), however the mitochondrial localization of SLC8A3 is controversial and SLC8A3 has a limited distribution among tissues.

Its oxidation to betaine provides a link to folate-dependent, one-carbon metabolism where betaine is a methyl donor in the methionine cycle.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4091	Butyrophilin (BTN) family interactions		Butyrophilins (BTNs) and butyrophilin like (BTNL) molecules are regulators of immune responses that belong to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily of transmembrane proteins. They are structurally related to the B7 family of co-stimulatory molecules and have similar immunomodulatory functions (Afrache et al. 2012, Arnett & Viney 2014). BTNs are implicated in T cell development, activation and inhibition, as well as in the modulation of the interactions of T cells with antigen presenting cells and epithelial cells. Certain BTNsare genetically associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (Abeler Domer et al. 2014). <br>The human butyrophilin family includes seven members that are subdivided into three subfamilies: BTN1, BTN2 and BTN3. The BTN1 subfamily contains only the prototypic single copy BTN1A1 gene, whereas the BTN2 and BTN3 subfamilies each contain three genes BTN2A1, BTN2A2 and BTN2A3, and BTN3A1, BTN3A2 and BTN3A3, respectively (note that BTN2A3 is a pseudogene). BTN1A1 has a crucial function in the secretion of lipids into milk (Ogg et al. 2004) and collectively, BTN2 and BTN3 proteins are cell surface transmembrane glycoproteins, that act as regulators of immune responses. BTNL proteins share considerable homology to the BTN family members. The human genome contains four BTNL genes: BTNL2, 3, 8 and 9 (Abeler Domer et al. 2014).

Its breakdown is a major source of energy for all cells, and is essential for the brain and red blood cells. Glucose utilization begins with its uptake by cells and conversion to glucose 6-phosphate, which cannot traverse the cell membrane. Fates open to cytosolic glucose 6-phosphate include glycolysis to yield pyruvate, glycogen synthesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway. In some tissues, notably the liver and kidney, glucose 6-phosphate can be synthesized from pyruvate by the pathway of gluconeogenesis.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4094	Collagen chain trimerization		The C-propeptides of collagen propeptide chains are essential for the association of three peptide chains into a trimeric but  non-helical procollagen. This initial binding event determines the composition of the trimer, brings the individual chains into the correct register and initiates formation of the triple helix at the C-terminus, which then proceeds towards the N-terminus in a zipper-like fashion (Engel & Prockop 1991). Most early refolding studies were performed with collagen type III, which contains a disulfide linkage at the C-terminus of its triple helix (BÃ¤chinger et al. 1978, Bruckner et al. 1978) that acts as a permanent linker even after removal of the non-collagenous domains. <br><br>Mutations within the C-propeptides further suggest that they are crucial for the correct interaction of the three polypeptide chains and for subsequent correct folding (refs. in Boudko et al. 2011).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4095	RET signaling		The RET proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed primarily in urogenital precursor cells, spermatogonocytes, dopaminergic neurons, motor neurons and neural crest progenitors and derived cells. . It is essential for kidney genesis, spermatogonial self-renewal and survivial, specification, migration, axonal growth and axon guidance of developing enteric neurons, motor neurons, parasympathetic neurons and somatosensory neurons (Schuchardt et al. 1994, Enomoto et al. 2001, Naughton et al. 2006, Kramer et al. 2006, Luo et al. 2006, 2009). RET was identified as the causative gene for human papillary thyroid carcinoma (Grieco et al. 1990), multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2A (Mulligan et al. 1993), type 2B (Hofstra et al. 1994, Carlson et al. 1994), and Hirschsprung's disease (Romeo et al. 1994, Edery et al. 1994).  <br><br>RET contains a cadherin-related motif and a cysteine-rich domain in the extracellular domain (Takahashi et al. 1988). It is the receptor for members of the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of ligands, GDNF (Lin et al. 1993), neurturin (NRTN) (Kotzbauer et al. 1996), artemin (ARTN) (Baloh et al. 1998), and persephin (PSPN) (Milbrandt et al. 1998), which form a family of neurotrophic factors. To stimulate RET, these ligands need a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored co-receptor, collectively termed GDNF family receptor-alpha (GFRA) (Treanor et al. 1996, Jing et al. 1996). The four members of this family have different, overlapping ligand preferences. GFRA1, GFRA2, GFRA3, and GFRA4 preferentially bind GDNF, NRTN, ARTN and PSPN, respectively (Jing et al. 1996, 1997, Creedon et al. 1997, Baloh et al. 1997, 1998, Masure et al. 2000). The GFRA co-receptor can come from the same cell as RET, or from a different cell. When the co-receptor is produced by the same cell as RET, it is termed cis signaling. When the co-receptor is produced by another cell, it is termed trans signaling. Cis and trans activation has been proposed to diversify RET signaling, either by recruiting different downstream effectors or by changing the kinetics or efficacy of kinase activation (Tansey et al. 2000, Paratcha et al. 2001). Whether cis and trans signaling has significant differences in vivo is unresolved (Fleming et al. 2015). Different GDNF family members could activate similar downstream signaling pathways since all GFRAs bind to and activate the same tyrosine kinase and induce coordinated phosphorylation of the same four RET tyrosines (Tyr905, Tyr1015, Tyr1062, and Tyr1096) with similar kinetics (Coulpier et al. 2002). However the exact RET signaling pathways in different types of cells and neurons remain to be determined.

P-type ATPases undergo conformational changes to translocate ions. Ligand-gated ion channels operate like a gate, opened or closed by a chemical signal.

Four modified nucleotides have been detected in 16S rRNA: 2'-O-methylguanosine-1145 catalyzed by MRM1, 2'-O-methylguanosine-1370 catalyzed by RNMTL1 (MRM3), 2'-O-methyluridine-1369 catalyzed by FTSJ2 (MRM2), and pseudouridine-1397. 2'-O-methyluridine-1369 and 2'-O-methylguanosone-1370 occur in the A-loop of rRNA which is located at the peptidyl transferase center of the large subunit. Here the modified residues play a role in interaction with the aminoacyl site of tRNA. Knockouts of TFB1M and NSUN4 are lethal in mice and mutations in TFB1M may be related to aminoglycoside-induced deafness (reviewed in Van Haute et al. 2015).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4101	Antimicrobial peptides		Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small molecular weight proteins with broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against bacteria, viruses, and fungi (Zasloff M 2002; Radek K & Gallo R 2007). The majority of known AMPs are cationic peptides with common structural characteristics where domains of hydrophobic and cationic amino acids are spatially arranged into an amphipathic design, which facilitates their interaction with bacterial membranes (Shai Y 2002; Yeaman MR & Yount NY 2003; Brown KL & Hancock RE 2006; Dennison SR et al. 2005; Zelezetsky I & Tossi A 2006). It is generally excepted that the electrostatic interaction facilitates the initial binding of the positively charged peptides to the negatively charged bacterial membrane. Moreover, the structural amphiphilicity of AMPs is thought to promote their integration into lipid bilayers of pathogenic cells, leading to membrane disintegration and finally to the microbial cell death. In addition to cationic AMPs a few anionic antimicrobial peptides have been found in humans, however their mechanism of action remains to be clarified (Lai Y et al. 2007; Harris F et al. 2009; Paulmann M et al. 2012). Besides the direct neutralizing effects on bacteria AMPs may modulate cells of the adaptive immunity (neutrophils, T-cells, macrophages) to control inflammation and/or to increase bacterial clearance.<p>AMPs have also been referred to as cationic host defense peptides, anionic antimicrobial peptides/proteins, cationic amphipathic peptides, cationic AMPs, host defense peptides and alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides (Brown KL & Hancock RE 2006; Harris F et al. 2009; Groenink J et al. 1999; Bradshaw J 2003; Riedl S et al. 2011; Huang Y et al. 2010).<p>The Reactome module describes the interaction events of various types of human AMPs, such as cathelicidin, histatins and neutrophil serine proteases, with conserved patterns of microbial membranes at the host-pathogen interface. The module includes also proteolytic processing events for dermcidin (DCD) and cathelicidin (CAMP) that become functional upon cleavage.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4102	Deubiquitination		Ubiquitination, the modification of proteins by the covalent attachment of ubiquitin (Ub), is a key regulatory mechanism for many many cellular processes, including protein degradation by the 26S proteasome. Ub conjugates linked via lysine 48 (K48) target substrates to the proteasome, whereas those linked via any of the six other Ub lysines can alter the function of the modified protein without leading to degradation. Deubiquitination, the reversal of this modification, regulates the function of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) catalyze the removal of Ub and regulate Ub-mediated pathways.<br><br>Given that Ub is covalently-linked to proteins destined to be degraded, it is a surprisingly long-lived protein in vivo (Haas & Bright 1987). This is due to the removal of Ub from its conjugates by DUBs prior to proteolysis. This may represent a quality control mechanism that prevents the degradation of proteins that were inappropriately tagged for degradation (Lam et al. 1997).  DUBs are responsible for processing inactive Ub precursors and for keeping the 26S proteasome free of unanchored Ub chains that compete for Ub-binding sites. <br><br>DUBs can be grouped into five families based on their conserved catalytic domains (Amerik & Hochstrasser 2004). Four of these families are thiol proteases and comprise the bulk of DUBs, while the fifth family is a small group of Ub specific metalloproteases. <br><br>Thiol protease DUBs contain a Cys-His-Asp/Asn catalytic triad in which the Asp/Asn functions to polarize and orient the His, while the His serves as a general acid/base by both priming the catalytic Cys for nucleophilic attack on the (iso)peptide carbonyl carbon and by donating a proton to the lysine epsilon-amino leaving group. The nucleophilic attack of the catalytic Cys on the carbonyl carbon produces a negatively charged transition state that is stabilized by an oxyanion hole composed of hydrogen bond donors. A Cys-carbonyl acyl intermediate ensues and is then hydrolyzed by nucleophilic attack of a water molecule to liberate a protein C-terminal carboxylate and regenerate the enzyme. Ub binding often causes structural rearrangements necessary for catalysis. Many DUBs are inactivated by oxidation of the catalytic cysteine to sulphenic acid (single bond SOH) (Cotto-Rios et al. 2012, Lee et al. 2013). This can be reversed by reduction with DTT or glutathione. The sulphenic acid can be irreversibly oxidized to sulphinic acid (single bond SO2H) or sulphonic acid (single bond SO3H). <br> <br>Thiol proteases are reversibly inhibited by Ub C-terminal aldehyde, forming a thio-hemiacetal between the aldehyde group and the active site thiol.

The digestion of starch begins with the action of amylase enzymes secreted in the saliva and small intestine, which convert it to maltotriose, maltose, limit dextrins, and some glucose. Digestion of the limit dextrins and disaccharides, both dietary and starch-derived, to monosaccharides - glucose, galactose, and fructose - is accomplished by enzymes located on the luminal surfaces of enterocytes lining the microvilli of the small intestine.<br>Dietary protein is hydrolyzed to dipeptides and amino acids by the action of pepsin in the stomach and an array of intestinal hydrolases.

CBFB does not interact with DNA directly. The Runt domain of RUNX1 mediated both DNA binding and heterodimerization with CBFB (Tahirov et al. 2001), while RUNX1 regions that flank the Runt domain are involved in transactivation (reviewed in Zhang et al. 2003) and negative regulation (autoinhibition). CBFB facilitates RUNX1 binding to DNA by stabilizing Runt domain regions that interact with the major and minor grooves of the DNA (Tahirov et al. 2001, Backstrom et al. 2002, Bartfeld et al. 2002). The transactivation domain of RUNX1 is located C-terminally to the Runt domain and is followed by the negative regulatory domain. Autoinhibiton of RUNX1 is relieved by interaction with CBFB (Kanno et al. 1998).<br>Transcriptional targets of the RUNX1:CBFB complex involve genes that regulate self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (Zhao et al. 2014), as well as commitment and differentiation of many hematopoietic progenitors, including myeloid (Friedman 2009) and megakaryocytic progenitors (Goldfarb 2009), regulatory T lymphocytes (Wong et al. 2011) and B lymphocytes (Boller and Grosschedl 2014).<br>RUNX1 binds to promoters of many genes involved in ribosomal biogenesis (Ribi) and is thought to stimulate their transcription. RUNX1 loss-of-function decreases ribosome biogenesis and translation in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). RUNX1 loss-of-function is therefore associated with a slow growth, but at the same time it results in reduced apoptosis and increases resistance of cells to genotoxic and endoplasmic reticulum stress, conferring an overall selective advantage to RUNX1 deficient HSPCs (Cai et al. 2015).<br>RUNX1 is implicated as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. RUNX1 forms a complex with the activated estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and regulates expression of estrogen-responsive genes (Chimge and Frenkel 2013).<br>RUNX1 is overexpressed in epithelial ovarian carcinoma where it may contribute to cell proliferation, migration and invasion (Keita et al. 2013).<br>RUNX1 may cooperate with TP53 in transcriptional activation of TP53 target genes upon DNA damage (Wu et al. 2013).<br>RUNX1 is needed for the maintenance of skeletal musculature (Wang et al. 2005).<br>During mouse embryonic development, Runx1 is expressed in most nociceptive sensory neurons, which are involved in the perception of pain. In adult mice, Runx1 is expressed only in nociceptive sensory neurons that express the Ret receptor and is involved in regulation of expression of genes encoding ion channels (sodium-gated, ATP-gated and hydrogen ion-gated) and receptors (thermal receptors, opioid receptor MOR and the Mrgpr class of G protein coupled receptors). Mice lacking Runx1 show defective perception of thermal and neuropathic pain (Chen CL et al. 2006). Runx1 is thought to activate the neuronal differentiation of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion cells during embryonal development possibly through repression of Hes1 expression (Kobayashi et al. 2012). In chick and mouse embryos, Runx1 expression is restricted to the dorso-medial domain of the dorsal root ganglion, to TrkA-positive cutaneous sensory neurons. Runx3 expression in chick and mouse embryos is restricted to ventro-lateral domain of the dorsal root ganglion, to TrkC-positive proprioceptive neurons (Chen AI et al. 2006, Kramer et al. 2006). RUNX1 mediated regulation of neuronally expressed genes will be annotated when mechanistic details become available.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4106	Cristae formation		"Cristae are invaginations of the inner mitochondrial membrane that extend into the matrix and are lined with cytochrome complexes and F1Fo ATP synthase complexes. Cristae increase the surface area of the inner membranes allowing greater numbers of respiratory complexes. Cristae are also believed to serve as ""proton pockets"" to generate localized regions of higher membrane potential. The steps in the biogenesis of cristae are not yet completely elucidated (reviewed in Zick et al. 2009) but the formation of the Mitochondrial Contact Site and Cristae Organizing System (MICOS, formerly also known as MINOS, reviewed in Rampelt et al. 2016, Kozjak-Pavlovic 2016, van der Laan et al. 2016) and localized concentrations of cardiolipin are known to define the inward curvature of the inner membrane at the bases of cristae. MICOS also links these regions of the inner membrane with complexes (the SAM complex and, in fungi, the TOM complex) embedded in the outer membrane. CHCHD3 (MIC19) and IMMT (MIC60) subunits of MICOS also interact with OPA1 at the inner membrane (Darshi et al. 2011, Glytsou et al. 2016).<br>Formation of dimers or oligomers of the F1Fo ATP synthase complex causes extreme curvature of the inner membrane at the apices of cristae (reviewed in Seelert and Dencher 2011, Habersetzer et al. 2013). Defects in either MICOS or F1Fo ATP synthase oligomerization produce abnormal mitochondrial morphologies.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4107	Transcriptional regulation by RUNX3		The transcription factor RUNX3 is a RUNX family member. All RUNX family members, RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3, possess a highly conserved Runt domain, involved in DNA binding. For a more detailed description of the structure of RUNX proteins, please refer to the pathway 'Transcriptional regulation by RUNX1'. Similar to RUNX1 and RUNX2, RUNX3 forms a transcriptionally active heterodimer with CBFB (CBF-beta). Studies in mice have shown that RUNX3 plays a role in neurogenesis and development of T lymphocytes. RUNX3 is implicated as a tumor suppressor gene in various human malignancies.<br>During nervous system formation, the Cbfb:Runx3 complex is involved in development of mouse proprioceptive dorsal root ganglion neurons by regulating expression of Ntrk3 (Neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 3) and possibly other genes (Inoue et al. 2002, Kramer et al. 2006, Nakamura et al. 2008, Dykes et al. 2011, Ogihara et al. 2016). It is not yet known whether RUNX3 is involved in human neuronal development and neuronal disorders.<br>RUNX3 plays a major role in immune response. RUNX3 regulates development of T lymphocytes. In mouse hematopoietic stem cells, expression of Runx3 is regulated by the transcription factor TAL1 (Landry et al. 2008). RUNX3 promotes the CD8+ lineage fate in developing thymocytes. In the CD4+ thymocyte lineage in mice, the transcription factor ThPOK induces transcription of SOCS family members, which repress Runx3 expression (Luckey et al. 2014). RUNX3, along with RUNX1 and ETS1, is implicated in regulation of transcription of the CD6 gene, encoding a lymphocyte surface receptor expressed on developing and mature T cells (Arman et al. 2009). RUNX3 and ThPOK regulate intestinal CD4+ T cell immunity in a TGF-beta and retinoic acid-dependent manner, which is important for cellular defense against intestinal pathogens (Reis et al. 2013). Besides T lymphocytes, RUNX3 is a key transcription factor in the commitment of innate lymphoid cells ILC1 and ILC3 (Ebihara et al. 2015). RUNX3 regulates expression of CD11A and CD49D integrin genes, involved in immune and inflammatory responses (Dominguez-Soto et al. 2005). RUNX3 is involved in mouse TGF-beta-mediated dendritic cell function and its deficiency is linked to airway inflammation (Fainaru et al. 2004).<br>In addition to its developmental role, RUNX3 is implicated as a tumor suppressor. The loss of RUNX3 expression and function was first causally linked to the genesis and progression of human gastric cancer (Li et al. 2002). Expression of RUNX3 increases in human pancreatic islet of Langerhans cells but not in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells in response to differentiation stimulus (serum withdrawal) (Levkovitz et al. 2010). Hypermethylation of the RUNX3 gene is associated with an increased risk for progression of Barrett's esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma (Schulmann et al. 2005). Hypermethylation-mediated silencing of the RUNX3 gene expression is also frequent in granulosa cell tumors (Dhillon et al. 2004) and has also been reported in colon cancer (Weisenberger et al. 2006), breast cancer (Lau et al. 2006, Huang et al. 2012), bladder cancer (Wolff et al. 2008) and gastric cancer (Li et al. 2002). In colorectal cancer, RUNX3 is one of the five markers in a gene panel used to classify CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP+) (Weisenberger et al. 2006).<br>RUNX3 and CBFB are frequently downregulated in gastric cancer. RUNX3 cooperates with TGF-beta to maintain homeostasis in the stomach and is involved in TGF-beta-induced cell cycle arrest of stomach epithelial cells. Runx3 knockout mice exhibit decreased sensitivity to TGF-beta and develop gastric epithelial hyperplasia (Li et al. 2002, Chi et al. 2005). RUNX3-mediated inhibition of binding of TEADs:YAP1 complexes to target promoters is also implicated in gastric cancer suppression (Qiao et al. 2016).<br>RUNX3 is a negative regulator of NOTCH signaling and RUNX3-mediated inhibition of NOTCH activity may play a tumor suppressor role in hepatocellular carcinoma (Gao et al. 2010, Nishina et al. 2011).<br>In addition to RUNX3 silencing through promoter hypermethylation in breast cancer (Lau et al. 2006), Runx3+/- mice are predisposed to breast cancer development. RUNX3 downregulates estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) protein levels in a proteasome-dependent manner (Huang et al. 2012).<br>Besides its tumor suppressor role, mainly manifested through its negative effect on cell proliferation, RUNX3 can promote cancer cell invasion by stimulating expression of genes involved in metastasis, such as osteopontin (SPP1) (Whittle et al. 2015).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4108	Aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling		The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix/PER-ARNT-SIM family of DNA binding proteins and controls the expression of a diverse set of genes. Two major types of environmental compounds can activate AHR signaling: halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) such as benzo(a)pyrene. Unliganded AHR forms a complex in the cytosol with two copies of 90kD heat shock protein (HSP90AB1), one X-associated protein (AIP), and one p23 molecular chaperone protein (PTGES3). After ligand binding and activation, the AHR complex translocates to the nucleus, disassociates from the chaperone subunits, dimerises with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) and transactivates target genes via binding to xenobiotic response elements (XREs) in their promoter regions. AHR targets genes of Phase I and Phase II metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), cytochorme P450 1B1 (CYP1B1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase I (NQO1) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 (ALHD3A1). This is thought to be an organism's response to foreign chemical exposure and normally, foreign chemicals are made less reactive by the induction and therefore increased activity of these enzymes (Beischlag et al. 2008).<br><br>AHR itself is regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR, aka BHLHE77, KIAA1234), an evolutionarily conserved bHLH-PAS protein that inhibits both xenobiotic-induced and constitutively active AHR transcriptional activity in many species. AHRR  resides predominantly in the nuclear compartment where it competes with AHR for binding to ARNT. As a result, there is competition between AHR:ARNT and AHRR:ARNT complexes for binding to XREs in target genes and AHRR can repress the transcription activity of AHR (Hahn et al. 2009, Haarmann-Stemmann & Abel 2006).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP411	mRNA processing		This process describes the conversion of precursor messenger RNA into mature messenger RNA (mRNA). The pre-mRNA molecule undergoes three main modifications. These modifications are 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and RNA splicing, which occur in the cell nucleus before the RNA is translated.5' Capping: Capping of the pre-mRNA involves the addition of 7-methylguanosine (m7G) to the 5' end. The cap protects the 5' end of the primary RNA transcript from attack by ribonucleases that have specificity to the 3'5' phosphodiester bonds.3' Processing: The pre-mRNA processing at the 3' end of the RNA molecule involves cleavage of its 3' end and then the addition of about 200 adenine residues to form a poly(A) tail. As the poly(A) tails is synthesised, it binds multiple copies of poly(A) binding protein, which protects the 3'end from ribonuclease digestion.Splicing: RNA splicing is the process by which introns, regions of RNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4111	Phase II - Conjugation of compounds		Phase II of biotransformation is concerned with <b><i>conjugation</i></b>, that is using groups from cofactors to react with functional groups present or introduced from phase I on the compound. The enzymes involved are a set of transferases which perform the transfer of the cofactor group to the substrate. The resultant conjugation results in greatly increasing the excretory potential of compounds. Although most conjugations result in pharmacological inactivation or detoxification, some can result in bioactivation. Most of the phase II enzymes are located in the cytosol except  UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT), which are microsomal. Phase II reactions are typically much faster than phase I reactions therefore the rate-limiting step for biotransformation of a compound is usually the phase I reaction.<br>Phase II metabolism can deal with all the products of phase I metabolism, be they reactive (Type I substrate) or unreactive/poorly active (Type II substrate) compounds. With the exception of glutathione, the conjugating species needs to be made chemically reactive after synthesis. The availability of the cofactor in the synthesis may be a rate-limiting factor in some phase II pathways as it may prevent the formation of enough conjugating species to deal with the substrate or it's metabolite. As many substrates and/or their metabolites are chemically reactive, their continued presence may lead to toxicity.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4113	Ketone body metabolism		Acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone collectively are called ketone bodies. The first two are synthesized from acetyl-CoA, in the mitochondria of liver cells; acetone is formed by spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetate. Ketone body synthesis in liver is effectively irreversible because the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of acetoacetate to acetoacetyl-CoA is not present in liver cells.<P>Ketone bodies, unlike fatty acids and triglycerides, are water-soluble. They are exported from the liver, and are taken up by other tissues, notably brain and skeletal and cardiac muscle. There, they are broken down to acetyl-CoA which is oxidized via the TCA cycle to yield energy. In a normal person, this pathway of ketone body synthesis and utilization is most active during extended periods of fasting. Under these conditions, mobilization and breakdown of stored fatty acids generates abundant acetyl-CoA acetyl-CoA in liver cells for synthesis of ketone bodies, and their utilization in other tissues minimizes the demand of these tissues for glucose (Sass 2011).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4115	Deregulated CDK5 triggers multiple neurodegenerative pathways in Alzheimer's disease models		Post-mitotic neurons do not have an active cell cycle. However, deregulation of Cyclin Dependent Kinase-5 (CDK5) activity in these neurons can aberrantly activate various components of cell cycle leading to neuronal death (Chang et al. 2012). Random activation of cell cycle proteins has been shown to play a key role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders (Yang et al. 2003, Lopes et al. 2009). CDK5 is not activated by the canonical cyclins, but binds to its own specific partners, CDK5R1 and CDK5R2 (aka p35 and p39, respectively) (Tsai et al. 1994, Tang et al. 1995). Expression of p35 is nearly ubiquitous, whereas p39 is largely expressed in the central nervous system. A variety of neurotoxic insults such as beta-amyloid (A-beta), ischemia, excitotoxicity and oxidative stress disrupt the intracellular calcium homeostasis in neurons, thereby leading to the activation of calpain, which cleaves p35 into p25 and p10 (Lee et al. 2000). p25 has a six-fold longer half-life compared to p35 and lacks the membrane anchoring signal, which results in its constitutive activation and mislocalization of the CDK5:p25 complex to the cytoplasm and the nucleus. There, CDK5:p25 is able to access and phosphorylate a variety of atypical targets, triggering a cascade of neurotoxic pathways that culminate in neuronal death. One such neurotoxic pathway involves CDK5-mediated random activation of cell cycle proteins which culminate in neuronal death. Exposure of primary cortical neurons to oligomeric beta-amyloid (1-42) hyper-activates CDK5 due to p25 formation, which in turn phosphorylates CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C. CDK5 phosphorylates CDC25A at S40, S116 and S261; CDC25B at S50, T69, S160, S321 and S470; and CDC25C at T48, T67, S122, T130, S168 and S214. CDK5-mediated phosphorylation of CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C not only increases their phosphatase activities but also facilitates their release from 14-3-3 inhibitory binding. CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C in turn activate CDK1, CDK2 and CDK4 kinases causing neuronal death. Consistent with this mechanism, higher CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C activities were observed in human Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical samples, as compared to age-matched controls. Inhibition of CDC25 isoforms confers neuroprotection to beta-amyloid toxicity, which underscores the contribution of this pathway to AD pathogenesis View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=8862803 Reactome].		9606

The synthesis itself is a single chemical reaction of free glucose and UDP-galactose to form lactose and UDP.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4117	Regulation of RUNX1 Expression and Activity		At the level of transcription, expression of the RUNX1 transcription factor is regulated by two alternative promoters: a distal promoter, P1, and a proximal promoter, P2. P1 is more than 7 kb upstream of P2 (Ghozi et al. 1996). In mice, the Runx1 gene is preferentially transcribed from the proximal P2 promoter during generation of hematopoietic cells from hemogenic endothelium. In fully committed hematopoietic progenitors, the Runx1 gene is preferentially transcribed from the distal P1 promoter (Sroczynska et al. 2009, Bee et al. 2010). In human T cells, RUNX1 is preferentially transcribed from P1 throughout development, while developing natural killer cells transcribe RUNX1 predominantly from P2. Developing B cells transcribe low levels of RUNX1 from both promoters (Telfer and Rothenberg 2001).<br>RUNX1 mRNAs transcribed from alternative promoters differ in their 5'UTRs and splicing isoforms of RUNX1 have also been described. The function of alternative splice isoforms and alternative 5'UTRs has not been fully elucidated (Challen and Goodell 2010, Komeno et al. 2014).<br>During zebrafish hematopoiesis, RUNX1 expression increases in response to NOTCH signaling, but direct transcriptional regulation of RUNX1 by NOTCH has not been demonstrated (Burns et al. 2005). RUNX1 transcription also increases in response to WNT signaling. BothTCF7 and TCF4 bind the RUNX1 promoter (Wu et al. 2012, Hoverter et al. 2012), and RUNX1 transcription driven by the TCF binding element (TBE) in response to WNT3A treatment is inhibited by the dominant-negative mutant of TCF4 (Medina et al. 2016). In developing mouse ovary, Runx1 expression is positively regulated by Wnt4 signaling (Naillat et al. 2015).<br>Studies in mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells imply that RUNX1 may be a direct transcriptional target of HOXB4 (Oshima et al. 2011).<br>Conserved cis-regulatory elements were recently identified in intron 5 of RUNX1. The RUNX1 breakpoints observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with translocation (8;21), which result in expression of a fusion RUNX1-ETO protein, cluster in intron 5, in proximity to these not yet fully characterized cis regulatory elements (Rebolledo-Jaramillo et al. 2014).<br>At the level of translation, RUNX1 expression is regulated by various microRNAs which bind to the 3'UTR of RUNX1 mRNA and inhibit its translation through endonucleolytic and/or nonendonucleolytic mechanisms. MicroRNAs that target RUNX1 include miR-378 (Browne et al. 2016), miR-302b (Ge et al. 2014), miR-18a (Miao et al. 2015), miR-675 (Zhuang et al. 2014), miR-27a (Ben-Ami et al. 2009), miR-17, miR-20a, miR106 (Fontana et al. 2007) and miR-215 (Li et al. 2016).<br>At the posttranslational level, RUNX1 activity is regulated by postranslational modifications and binding to co-factors. SRC family kinases phosphorylate RUNX1 on multiple tyrosine residues in the negative regulatory domain, involved in autoinhibition of RUNX1. RUNX1 tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with reduced binding of RUNX1 to GATA1 and increased binding of RUNX1 to the SWI/SNF complex, leading to inhibition of RUNX1-mediated differentiation of T-cells and megakaryocytes. SHP2 (PTPN11) tyrosine phosphatase binds to RUNX1 and dephosphorylates it (Huang et al. 2012).<br>Formation of the complex with CBFB is necessary for the transcriptional activity of RUNX1 (Wang et al. 1996). Binding of CCND3 and probably other two cyclin D family members, CCND1 and CCND2, to RUNX1 inhibits its association with CBFB (Peterson et al. 2005), while binding to CDK6 interferes with binding of RUNX1 to DNA without affecting formation of the RUNX1:CBFB complex. Binding of RUNX1 to PML plays a role in subnuclear targeting of RUNX1 (Nguyen et al. 2005).<br>RUNX1 activity and protein levels vary during the cell cycle. RUNX1 protein levels increase from G1 to S and from S to G2 phases, with no increase in RUNX1 mRNA levels. CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of RUNX1 at the G2/M transition is implicated in reduction of RUNX1 transactivation potency and may promote RUNX1 protein degradation by the anaphase promoting complex (reviewed by Friedman 2009).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4119	Listeria monocytogenes entry into host cells		Listeria monocytogenes is a short, gram-positive, nonspore-forming motile rod. Serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b and 4b make up more than 95% of isolates from humans, with serotype 4b causing most of the food-borne outbreaks. Listeria monocytogenes enters the body through the gastrointestinal tract after ingestion of contaminated food. The bacteria can survive food preservation procedures, such as refrigeration, low pH and high salt.<br>Listeria monocytogenes expresses several adhesin proteins at the cell surface that facilitate bacterial binding and entry to host cells. The bacteria can enter host cells through endocytosis mediated by binding of the bacterial InlA (internalin) protein to CDH1 (E-cadherin) at the host cell plasma membrane. Listeria monocytogenes can also enter host cells through endocytosis mediated by binding of the bacterial InlB protein to MET receptor tyrosine kinase at the host cell plasma membrane. Listeria monocytogenes proliferates inside the host cells and triggers formation of filopods, elongated protrusions of the host plasma membrane that contain bacteria. Filopods are ingested by adjacent cells, allowing Listeria monocytogenes to spread from cell to cell, invisible to the immune system of the host.<br>Listeria monocytogenes can cross the intestinal, blood-brain and placental barriers. In immunocompetent adults Listeria monocytogenes infection usually causes gastroenteritis. In infants infected in utero and in immunocompromised adults Listeria monocytogenes infection can result in meningoencephalitis and bacteremia (sepsis).<br>InlA is critical for crossing the intestinal barrier while both InlA and InlB are needed for crossing the placental barrier (Gessain et al. 2015) and, based on in vitro studies, the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (Grundler et al. 2013). It seems that the intrinsic level of PI3K activity in Listeria-targeted host cells determines whether the entry depends on InlA only or InlA and InlB. The interaction of InlA with E-cadherin does not activate PI3K/AKT signaling while the interaction of InlB with the MET receptor activated the PI3K/AKT signal transduction cascade. Therefore, InlB-MET interaction may be important in tissues with low intrinsic PI3K activity (Gessain et al. 2015). Even if InlA-E-cadherin route is sufficient for bacterial entry, InlB may accelerate bacterial invasion (Pentecost et al. 2010). Cholesterol levels in host cell plasma membrane may also influence the preferred route for bacterial endocytosis (Seveau et al. 2004). In addition to InlA and InlB, many other virulence factors are involved in the Listeria monocytogenes infection cycle (Camejo et al. 2011) and will be annotated as mechanistic details become available.<br>For review, please refer to Bonazzi et al. 2009, Brooks et al. 2010, Camejo et al. 2011, Pizarro-Cerda et al. 2012.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4120	Signaling by MET		MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) (Cooper et al. 1984, Park et al. 1984) activated by binding to its ligand, Hepatocyte growth factor/Scatter factor (HGF/SF) (Bottaro et al. 1991, Naldini et al. 1991). Similar to other related RTKs, such as EGFR, ligand binding induces MET dimerization and trans-autophosphorylation, resulting in the active MET receptor complex (Ferracini et al. 1991, Longati et al. 1994, Rodrigues and Park 1994, Kirchhofer et al. 2004, Stamos et al. 2004, Hays and Watowich 2004). Phosphorylated tyrosines in the cytoplasmic tail of MET serve as docking sites for binding of adapter proteins, such as GRB2, SHC1 and GAB1, which trigger signal transduction cascades that activate PI3K/AKT, RAS, STAT3, PTK2, RAC1 and RAP1 signaling (Ponzetto et al. 1994, Pelicci et al. 1995, Weidner et al. 1995, Besser et al. 1997, Shen and Novak 1997, Beviglia and Kramer 1999, Rodrigues et al. 2000, Sakkab et al. 2000, Schaeper et al. 2000, Lamorte et al. 2002, Wang et al. 2002, Chen and Chen 2006, Palamidessi et al. 2008, Chen et al. 2011, Murray et al. 2014).<br>Activation of PLC gamma 1 (PLCG1) signaling by MET remains unclear. It has been reported that PLCG1 can bind to MET directly (Ponzetto et al. 1994) or be recruited by phosphorylated GAB1 (Gual et al. 2000). Tyrosine residue Y307 of GAB1 that serves as docking sites for PLCG1 may be phosphorylated either by activated MET (Watanabe et al. 2006) or SRC (Chan et al. 2010). Another PCLG1 docking site on GAB1, tyrosine residue Y373, was reported as the SRC target, while the kinase for the main PLCG1 docking site, Y407 of GAB1, is not known (Chan et al. 2010).<br>Signaling by MET promotes cell growth, cell survival and motility, which are essential for embryonic development (Weidner et al. 1993, Schmidt et al. 1995, Uehara et al. 1995, Bladt et al. 1995, Maina et al. 1997, Maina et al. 2001, Helmbacher et al. 2003) and tissue regeneration (Huh et al. 2004, Borowiak et al. 2004, Liu 2004, Chmielowiec et al. 2007). MET signaling is frequently aberrantly activated in cancer, through MET overexpression or activating MET mutations (Schmidt et al. 1997, Pennacchietti et al. 2003, Smolen et al. 2006, Bertotti et al. 2009).<br>Considerable progress has recently been made in the development of HGF-MET inhibitors in cancer therapy. These include inhibitors of HGF activators, HGF inhibitors and MET antagonists, which are protein therapeutics that act outside the cell. Kinase inhibitors function inside the cell and have constituted the largest effort towards MET-based therapeutics (Gherardi et al. 2012).<br>Pathogenic bacteria of the species Listeria monocytogenes, exploit MET receptor as an entryway to host cells (Shen et al. 2000, Veiga and Cossart 2005, Neimann et al. 2007).<br>For review of MET signaling, please refer to Birchmeier et al. 2003, Trusolino et al. 2010, Gherardi et al. 2012, Petrini 2015.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4121	Neddylation		NEDD8 is a small ubiquitin-like molecule that is conjugated to substrate proteins through an E1 to E3 enzyme cascade similar to that for ubiquitin. The best characterized target of neddylation is the cullin scaffold subunit of cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), which themselves target numerous cellular proteins for degradation by the proteasome (Hori et al, 1999; reviewed in Soucy et al, 2010; Lyedeard et al, 2013). The multisubunit CRL complexes are compositionally diverse, but each contains a scaffolding cullin protein (CUL1, 2, 3, 4A, 4B, 5, 7 or 9) and a RING box-containing E3 ligase subunit RBX, along with other adaptor and substrate-interacting subunits. RBX2 (also known as RNF7) interacts preferentially with CUL5, while RBX1 is the primary E3 for most other cullin family members (reviewed in Mahon et al, 2014). Neddylation of the cullin subunit increases the ubiquitination activity of the CRL complex (Podust et al, 2000; Read et al, 2000; Wu et al, 2000; Kawakami et al, 2001; Ohh et al, 2002; Yu et al, 2015). In addition to CRL complexes, a number of other less-well characterized NEDD8 targets have been identified. These include other E3 ubiquitin ligases such as SMURF1 and MDM2, receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR and TGF beta RII, and proteins that contribute to transcriptional regulation, among others (Xie et al, 2014; Watson et al, 2010; Oved et al, 2006; Zuo et al, 2013; Xirodimas et al, 2004; Singh et al, 2007; Abida et al, 2007; Liu et al 2010; Watson et al, 2006; Loftus et al, 2012; Aoki et al, 2013; reviewed in Enchev et al, 2015). <br>Like ubiquitin, NEDD8 undergoes post-translational processing to generate the mature form. UCHL3- or SENP8-mediated proteolysis removes the C-terminal 5 amino acids of NEDD8, generating a novel C-terminal glycine residue for conjugation to the cysteine residues in the E1, E2 enzymes or lysine residues in the substrate protein, usually the E3 NEDD8 ligase itself (Wada et al, 1998; reviewed in Enchev et al, 2015). Most substrates in vivo appear to be singly neddylated on one or more lysine residues, but NEDD8 chains have been formed on cullin substrates in vitro and on histone H4 in cultured human cells after DNA damage (Jones et al, 2008; Ohki et al, 2009; Xirodimas et al, 2008; Jeram et al, 2010; Ma et al, 2013; reviewed in Enchev et al, 2015). The significance of NEDD8 chains is still not clear. <br>NEDD8 has a single heterodimeric E1 enzyme, consisting of NAE1 (also known as APPBP1) and UBA3, and two E2 enzymes, UBE2M and UBE2F, which are N-terminally acetylated (Walden et al, 2003; Bohnsack et al, 2003; Huang et al, 2004; Huang et al, 2005; Huang et al, 2009; Scott et al, 2011a; Monda et al, 2013; reviewed in Enchev et al, 2015). All NEDD8 E3 enzymes reported to date also function as E3 ubiquitin ligases, and most belong to the RING domain class. The best characterized NEDD8 E3 enzymes are the CRL complexes described above. RBX1-containing complexes interact preferentially with UBE2M, while UBE2F is the E2 for RBX2-containing complexes (Huang et al, 2009; Monda et al, 2013). <br>Neddylation is regulated in vivo by interaction with DCUN1D proteins (also called DCNLs). The 5 human DCUN1D proteins interact both with cullins and with the NEDD8 E2 proteins and thereby increase the kinetic efficiency of neddylation (Kurz et al, 2005; Kurz et al, 2008; Scott et al, 2010; Scott et al, 2011a; Scott et al, 2014; Monda et al, 2013). Glomulin (GLMN) is another regulator of CRL function that binds to the neddylated cullin and competitively inhibits interaction with the ubiquitin E2 enzyme (Arai et al, 2003; Tron et al, 2012; Duda et al, 2012; reviewed in Mahon et al, 2014).<br>The multisubunit COP9 signalosome is the only cullin deneddylase, while SENP8 (also known as DEN1) contributes to deneddylation of other non-cullin NEDD8 targets (Cope et al, 2002; Emberley et al, 2012; Chan et al, 2008; Wu et al, 2003; reviewed in Wei et al, 2008; Enchev et al, 2015). In the deneddylated state, cullins bind to CAND1 (cullin associated NEDD8-dissociated protein1), which displaces the COP9 signalosome and promotes the exchange of the ubiquitin substrate-specific adaptor. This allows CRL complexes to be reconfigured to target other subtrates for ubiquitination (Liu et al, 2002; Schmidt et al, 2009; Pierce et al, 2013; reviewed in Mahon et al, 2014).<br><br> View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=8951664 Reactome].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4122	Interleukin-6 family signaling		The interleukin-6 (IL6) family of cytokines includes IL6, IL11, IL27, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin 1 and 2 (CT-1) and cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) (Heinrich et al. 2003, Pflanz et al. 2002). The latest addition to this family is IL31, discovered in 2004 (Dillon et al. 2004). The family is defined largely by the shared use of the common signal transducing receptor Interleukin-6 receptor subunit beta (IL6ST, gp130). The IL31 receptor uniquely does not include this subunit, instead it uses the related IL31RA. The members of the IL6 family share very low sequence homology but are structurally highly related, forming anti-parallel four-helix bundles with a characteristic â€œup-up-down-downâ€� topology (Rozwarski et al. 1994, Cornelissen et al. 2012).<br><br>Although each member of the IL6 family signals through a distinct receptor complex, their underlying signaling mechanisms are similar. Assembly of the receptor complex is followed by activation of receptor-associated Janus kinases (JAKs), believed to be constitutively associated with the receptor subunits.Activation of JAKs initiates downstream cytoplasmic signaling cascades that involve recruitment and phosphorylation of transcription factors of the Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family, which dimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they bind enhancer elements of target genes leading to transcriptional activation (Nakashima & Taga 1998).<br><br>Negative regulators of IL6 signaling include Suppressor of cytokine signals (SOCS) family members and PTPN11 (SHP-2).<br><br>IL6 is a pleiotropic cytokine with roles in processes including immune regulation, hematopoiesis, inflammation, oncogenesis, metabolic control and sleep. <br><br>IL6 and IL11 bind their corresponding specific receptors IL6R and IL11R respectively, resulting in dimeric complexes that subsequently associate with IL6ST, leading to IL6ST homodimer formation (in a hexameric or higher order complex) and signal initiation. IL6R alpha exists in transmembrane and soluble forms. The transmembrane form is mainly expressed by hepatocytes, neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and some lymphocytes. Soluble forms of IL6R (sIL6R) are also expressed by these cells. Two major mechanisms for the production of sIL6R have been proposed. Alternative splicing generates a transcript lacking the transmembrane domain by using splicing donor and acceptor sites that flank the transmembrane domain coding region. This also introduces a frameshift leading to the incorporation of 10 additional amino acids at the C terminus of sIL6R.A second mechanism for the generation of sIL6R is the proteolytic cleavage or 'shedding' of membrane-bound IL-6R. Two proteases ADAM10 and ADAM17 are thought to contribute to this (Briso et al. 2008). sIL6R can bind IL6 and stimulate cells that express gp130 but not IL6R alpha, a process that is termed trans-signaling. This explains why many cells, including hematopoietic progenitor cells, neuronal cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and embryonic stem cells, do not respond to IL6 alone, but show a remarkable response to IL6/sIL6R. It is clear that the trans-signaling pathway is responsible for the pro-inflammatory activities of IL6 whereas the membrane bound receptor governs regenerative and anti-inflammatory IL6 activities<br><br>LIF, CNTF, OSM, CTF1, CRLF1 and CLCF1 signal via IL6ST:LIFR heterodimeric receptor complexes (Taga & Kishimoto 1997, Mousa & Bakhiet 2013). OSM signals via a receptor complex consisting of IL6ST and OSMR. These cytokines play important roles in the regulation of complex cellular processes such as gene activation, proliferation and differentiation (Heinrich et al. 1998). <br><br>Antibodies have been developed to inhibit IL6 activity for the treatment of inflammatory diseases (Kopf et al. 2010).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4124	Cilium Assembly		Cilia are membrane covered organelles that extend from the surface of eukaryotic cells. Cilia may be motile, such as respiratory cilia) or non-motile (such as the primary cilium) and are distinguished by the structure of their microtubule-based axonemes. The axoneme consists of nine peripheral doublet microtubules, and in the case of many motile cilia, may also contain a pair of central single microtubules. These are referred to as 9+0 or 9+2 axonemes, respectively. Relative to their non-motile counterparts, motile cilia also contain additional structures that contribute to motion, including inner and outer dynein arms, radial spokes and nexin links. Four main types of cilia have been identified in humans: 9+2 motile (such as respiratory cilia), 9+0 motile (nodal cilia), 9+2 non-motile (kinocilium of hair cells) and 9+0 non-motile (primary cilium and photoreceptor cells)  (reviewed in Fliegauf et al, 2007).This pathway describes cilia formation, with an emphasis on the primary cilium. The primary cilium is a sensory organelle that is required for the transduction of numerous external signals such as growth factors, hormones and morphogens, and an intact primary cilium is needed for signaling pathways mediated by Hh, WNT, calcium, G-protein coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases, among others (reviewed in Goetz and Anderson, 2010; Berbari et al, 2009; Nachury, 2014). Unlike the motile cilia, which are generally present in large numbers on epithelial cells and are responsible for sensory function as well as wave-like beating motions, the primary cilium is a non-motile sensory organelle that is present in a single copy at the apical surface of most quiescent cells (reviewed in Hsiao et al, 2012). Cilium biogenesis involves the anchoring of the basal body, a centriole-derived organelle, near the plasma membrane and the subsequent polymerization of the microtubule-based axoneme and extension of the plasma membrane (reviewed in Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011; Reiter et al, 2012). Although the ciliary membrane is continuous with the plasma membrane, the protein and lipid content of the cilium and the ciliary membrane are distinct from those of the bulk cytoplasm and plasma membrane (reviewed in Emmer et al, 2010; Rohatgi and Snell, 2010). This specialized compartment is established and maintained during cilium biogenesis by the formation of a ciliary transition zone, a proteinaceous structure that, with the transition fibres, anchors the basal body to the plasma membrane and acts as a ciliary pore to limit free diffusion from the cytosol to the cilium (reviewed in Nachury et al, 2010; Reiter et al, 2012). Ciliary components are targeted from the secretory system to the ciliary base and subsequently transported to the ciliary tip, where extension of the axoneme occurs, by a motor-driven process called intraflagellar transport (IFT). Anterograde transport of cargo from the ciliary base to the tip of the cilium requires kinesin-2 type motors, while the dynein-2 motor is required for retrograde transport back to the ciliary base.  In addition, both anterograde and retrograde transport depend on the IFT complex, a multiprotein assembly consisting of two subcomplexes, IFT A and IFT B. The primary cilium is a dynamic structure that undergoes continuous steady-state turnover of tubulin at the tip; as a consequence, the IFT machinery is required for cilium maintenance as well as biogenesis (reviewed in Bhogaraju et al, 2013; Hsiao et al, 2012; Li et al, 2012; Taschner et al, 2012; Sung and Leroux, 2013). The importance of the cilium in signaling and cell biology is highlighted by the wide range of defects and disorders, collectively known as ciliopathies, that arise as the result of mutations in genes encoding components of the ciliary machinery (reviewed in Goetz and Anderson, 2010; Madhivanan and Aguilar, 2014).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4125	Protein ubiquitination		Ubiquitin is a small, 76 amino acid residue protein that is conjugated by E3 ubiquitin ligases to other proteins in order to regulate their function or degradation (enzymatic cascade reviewed in Neutzner and Neutzner 2012, Kleiger and Mayor 2014, structures and mechanisms of conjugating enzymes reviewed in Lorenz et al. 2013). Ubiquitination of target proteins usually occurs between the C-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin and a lysine residue of the target, although linkages with cysteine, serine, and threonine residues are also observed (reviewed in Wang et al. 2012, McDowell and Philpott 2013).<br>Ubiquitin must first be processed from larger precursors and then activated by formation of a thiol ester bond between ubiquitin and an E1 activating enzyme (UBA1 or UBA6) and transfer to an E2 conjugating enzyme before being transferred by an E3 ligase to a target protein. Precursor proteins containing multiple ubiquitin monomers (polyubiquitins) are produced from the UBB and UBC genes; precursors containing a single ubiquitin monomer and a ribosomal protein are produced from the UBA52 and RPS27A genes. Many proteases (deubiquitinases) may potentially process these precursors yielding monomeric ubiquitin. The proteases OTULIN and USP5 are particularly active in cleaving the polyubiquitin precursors, whereas the proteases UCHL3, USP7, and USP9X cleave the ubiquitin-ribosomal protein precursors yielding ubiquitin monomers (Grou et al. 2015). A resultant ubiquitin monomer is activated by adenylation of the C-terminal glycine followed by conjugation of the C-terminus to a cysteine residue of the E1 enzymes UBA1 or UBA6 via a thiol ester bond. The ubiquitin is then transferred from the E1 enzyme to a cysteine residue of one of several E2 enzymes (reviewed in van Wijk and Timmers 2010, Stewart et al. 2016). Through a less well characterized mechanism, E3 ubiquitin ligases then bring a target protein and the E2-ubiquitin conjugate into proximity so that the ubiquitin is transferred via formation of an amide bond to a particular lysine residue (or, in rarer cases, a thiol ester bond to a cysteine residue or an ester bond to a serine or threonine residue) of the target protein (reviewed in Berndsen and Wolberger 2014). Based on protein homologies, families of E3 ubiquitin ligases have been identified that include RING-type ligases (reviewed in Deshaies et al. 2009, Metzger et al. 2012, Metzger et al. 2014), HECT-type ligases (reviewed in Rotin et al. 2009, Metzger et al. 2012), and RBR-type ligases (reviewed in Dove et al. 2016). A subset of the RING-type ligases participate in CULLIN-RING ligase complexes (CRLs which include SCF complexes, reviewed in Lee and Zhou 2007, Genschik et al. 2013, Skaar et al. 2013, Lee et al. 2014).<br>Some E3-E2 combinations catalyze mono-ubiquitination of the target protein (reviewed in Nakagawa and Nakayama 2015). Other E3-E2 combinations catalyze conjugation of further ubiquitin monomers to the initial ubiquitin, forming polyubiquitin chains. (It may also be possible for some E3-E2 combinations to preassemble polyubiquitin and transfer it as a unit to the target protein.) Ubiquitin contains several lysine (K) residues and a free alpha amino group  to which further ubiquitin can be conjugated. Thus different types of polyubiquitin are possible: K11 linked polyubiquitin is observed in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), K29 linked polyubiquitin is observed in lysosomal degradation, K48 linked polyubiquitin directs target proteins to the proteasome for degradation, whereas K63 linked polyubiquitin generally acts as a scaffold to recruit other proteins in several cellular processes, notably DNA repair (reviewed in Komander et al. 2009). Ubiquitination is highly regulated (reviewed in Vittal et al. 2015) and affects all cellular processes including DNA damage response (reviewed in Brown and Jackson 2015), immune signaling (reviewed in Park et al. 2014, Lutz-Nicoladoni et al. 2015), and regulation of normal and cancerous cell growth (reviewed in Skaar and Pagano 2009, Yerlikaya and Yontem 2013, Strikoudis et al. 2014).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4126	Galactose catabolism		The main sources of galactose in the human diet are milk and milk products. The disaccharide lactose from these sources is hydrolyzed in the intestine to its constituent monosaccharides, glucose and galactose. Galactose is metabolized primarily in the liver in a sequence of three reactions that yield one molecule of glucose 1-phosphate per molecule of galactose. First, it is phosphorylated to yield galactose 1-phosphate. Then, galactose 1-phosphate and UDP-glucose react to form UDP-galactose and glucose 1-phosphate, and UDP-galactose undergoes epimerization to form UDP-glucose. In a reaction shared with other pathways, glucose 1-phosphate can be converted into glucose 6-phosphate (Holton et al. 2001; Elsas and Lai 2001).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4129	Plasma lipoprotein assembly, remodeling, and clearance		Because of their hydrophobicity, lipids are found in the extracellular spaces of the human body primarily in the form of lipoprotein complexes. <b>Chylomicrons</b> form in the small intestine and transport dietary lipids to other tissues in the body. <b>Very low density lipoproteins (VLDL)</b> form in the liver and transport triacylglycerol synthesized there to other tissues of the body.

IDL and LDL are cleared from the circulation via a specific cell surface receptor, found in the body primarily on the surfaces of liver cells. <b>High density lipoprotein (HDL)</b> particles, initially formed primarily by the liver, shuttle several kinds of lipids between tissues and other lipoproteins.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4131	Triglyceride metabolism		Fatty acids derived from the diet and synthesized de novo in the liver are assembled into triglycerides (triacylglycerols) for transport and storage. Synthesis proceeds in steps of conversion of fatty acyl-CoA to phosphatidic acid, conversion of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol, and conversion of diacylglycerol to triacylglycerol (Takeuchi & Reue 2009).<br>Hydrolysis of triacylglycerol to yield fatty acids and glycerol is a tightly regulated part of energy metabolism. A central part in this regulation is played by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), a neutral lipase abundant in adipocytes and skeletal and cardiac muscle, but also abundant in ovarian and adrenal tissue, where it mediates cholesterol ester hydrolysis, yielding cholesterol for steroid biosynthesis. The hormones to which it is sensitive include catecholamines (e.g., epinephrine), ACTH, and glucagon, all of which trigger signaling cascades that lead to its phosphorylation and activation, and insulin, which sets off events leading to its dephosphorylation and inactivation (Kraemer & Shen 2002).<p>The processes of triacylglycerol and cholesterol ester hydrolysis are also regulated by subcellular compartmentalization: these lipids are packaged in cytosolic particles and the enzymes responsible for their hydrolysis, and perhaps for additional steps in their metabolism, are organized at the surfaces of these particles (e.g., Brasaemle et al. 2004).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4132	RUNX1 regulates genes involved in megakaryocyte differentiation and platelet function		In human hematopoietic progenitors, RUNX1 and its partner CBFB are up-regulated at the onset of megakaryocytic differentiation and down-regulated at the onset of erythroid differentiation. The complex of RUNX1 and CBFB cooperates with the transcription factor GATA1 in the transactivation of megakaryocyte-specific genes. In addition, RUNX1 and GATA1 physically interact (Elagib et al. 2003), and this interaction involves the zinc finger domain of GATA1 (Xu et al. 2006). Other components of the RUNX1:CBFB activating complex at megakaryocytic promoters are GATA1 heterodimerization partner, ZFPM1 (FOG1), histone acetyltransferases EP300 (p300) and KAT2B (PCAF), the WDR5-containing histone methyltransferase MLL complex and the arginine methyltransferase PRMT1 (Herglotz et al. 2013). In the absence of PRMT1, the transcriptional repressor complex can form at megakaryocytic promoters, as RUNX1 that is not arginine methylated can bind to SIN3A/SIN3B co-repressors (Zhao et al. 2008). Besides SIN3A/SIN3B, the RUNX1:CBFB repressor complex at megakaryocytic promoters also includes histone deacetylase HDAC1 and histone arginine methyltransferase PRMT6 (Herglotz et al. 2013).<br>Megakaryocytic promoters regulated by the described RUNX1:CBFB activating and repressing complexes include ITGA2B, GP1BA, THBS1 and MIR27A (Herglotz et al. 2013). ITGA2B is only expressed in maturing megakaryocytes and platelets and is involved in platelet aggregation (Block and Poncz 1995). GP1BA is expressed at the cell surface membrane of maturing megakaryocytes and platelets and participates in formation of platelet plugs (Cauwenberghs et al. 2000, Jilma-Stohlawetz et al. 2003, Debili et al. 1990). THBS1 homotrimers contribute to stabilization of the platelet aggregate (Bonnefoy and Hoylaerts 2008). MIR27A is a negative regulator of RUNX1 mRNA translation and may be involved in erythroid/megakaryocytic lineage determination (Ben-Ami et al. 2009).<br>The RUNX1:CBFB complex stimulates transcription of the PF4 gene, encoding a component of platelet alpha granules (Aneja et al. 2011), the NR4A3 gene, associated with the familial platelet disorder (FPD) (Bluteau et al. 2011), the PRKCQ gene, associated with inherited thrombocytopenia (Jalagadugula et al. 2011), the MYL9 gene, involved in thrombopoiesis (Jalagadugula et al. 2010), and the NFE2 gene, a regulator of erythroid and megakaryocytic maturation and differentiation (Wang et al. 2010).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4133	Neurexins and neuroligins		Neurexins (NRXNs) and neuroligins (NLGNs) are best characterized synaptic cell-adhesion molecules. They are part of excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic synapses in mammalian brain, mediate trans-synaptic signaling, and shape neural network properties by specifying synaptic functions. As cell-adhesion molecules, NRXNs and NLGNs probably function by binding to each other and by interacting with intracellular PDZ-domain proteins, but the precise mechanisms involved and their relation to synaptic transmission remain unclear. The binding of NRXNs and NLGNs to their partners, helps to align the pre-synaptic release machinery and post-synaptic receptors. The importance of neurexins and neuroligins for synaptic function is evident from the dramatic deficits in synaptic transmission in mice lacking Nrxns or Nlgns. In humans, alterations in NRXNs or NLGNs genes are implicated in autism and other cognitive diseases, connecting synaptic cell adhesion to cognition and its disorders (Sudhof 2008, Craig et al. 2006, Craig & Kang 2007).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4135	RNA Polymerase III Transcription		RNA polymerase III is one of three types of nuclear RNA polymerases present in eucaryotic cells.  About 10% of the total transcription in dividing cells can be attributed to its activity.  It synthesizes an eclectic collection of catalytic or structural RNA molecules, some of which are involved in protein synthesis, pre-mRNA splicing, tRNA processing, and the control of RNA polymerase II elongation, whereas some others have still unknown functions.  Like other RNA polymerases, RNA polymerase III cannot recognize its target promoters directly.  Instead it is recruited to specific promoter sequences through the help of transcription factors.  There are three basic types of RNA polymerase III promoters, called types 1, 2, and 3(Geiduschek and Kassavetis, 1992).  Although in vivo, RNA polymerase III may be recruited to these promoters as part of a large complex (holo RNA polymerase III) containing the polymerase and its initiation factors (Wang et al., 1997), in vitro the reaction can be divided into several steps.  First, the promoter elements are recognized by DNA binding factors, which then recruit a factor known as TFIIIB.  TFIIIB itself then directly contacts RNA polymerase III.  In human cells but not in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, there are at least two versions of TFIIIB.  One contains TBP, Bdp1, and Brf1 (Brf1-TFIIIB), and the other TBP, Bdp1, and Brf2 (Brf2-TFIIIB) (Schramm et al., 2000; Teichmann et al., 2000).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4136	Fibrin complement receptor 3 signaling pathway		The blood protein fibrinogen, a key component of the coagulation cascade, has been identified as an early molecular factor triggering inflammation in the brain and periphery (see bibliography). Upon fibrinogen extravasation across leaky vessels (i.e., break down of the blood-brain barrier), fibrinogen is converted by thrombin to insoluble fibrin. Based on published studies, this signaling pathway highlights fibrin as a CD11b/CD18 (complement receptor; CR3) integrin receptor ligand that regulates innate immunity. Fibrin activates central nervous system (CNS) resident microglia and peripheral (bone marrow-derived) macrophages via CR3, leading to intracellular kinase signaling activation including PI3K, AKT1, and RhoA activity that regulates phagocytosis; and NF-κB translocation to the nucleus that transcriptionally regulates proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that recruit T-cells and macrophages. Canonical LPS-TLR4 activation of innate immune cells and potential mechanisms of CD11b transactivation are shown.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4136 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4141	PI3K/AKT/mTOR - vitamin D3 signaling		"Pathway representation of the model proposed by Ferreira et al. in the Figure 7 C of their article: ""Proposed model for the mechanism of action of 1,25(OH)2D3 in human-monocyte-derived DCs. We hypothesize that VDR-bound 1,25(OH)2D3 activates the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway via either forming a complex and phosphorylating the regulatory subunit of PI3K, or by other unknown mechanisms. This releases and activates the catalytic subunit, which unleashes the PI3K downstream pathway. Among other functions, activation of this pathway promotes the expression of different key glycolytic enzymes, which induces glycolysis. Control of surface marker expression and cytokine production by 1,25(OH)2D3 might arise from its impact on the PI3K pathway, which can control essential transcription factors (e.g., GSK-3ÃŽÂ² and NF-ÃŽÂºB nuclear translocation) or from the direct regulation of transcription factors, key metabolic bifunctional enzymes, and RNA binding proteins. In the absence of glucose or glycolysis, an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio will be sensed by AMPK, which, in turn, phosphorylates TSC2 and blocks activation of the mTOR complex and its downstream processes. We further consider that the increase in OXPHOS also seen in 1,25D3-DCs is derived from the excess pyruvate generated during induced glycolysis, in addition to the control of metabolic enzymes from the oxidative branch by 1,25(OH)2D3"".Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4141 CPTAC Assay Portal]"		9606

This compound is a precursor to GABA, glutamate, and glycine in certain brain areas, acts on the GHB receptor and is a weak agonist at the GABAB receptor.GHB has been used in a medical setting as a general anesthetic and as a treatment for cataplexy, narcolepsy, and alcoholism. It is also used illegally as an intoxicant, to try to increase athletic performance, and as a date rape drug. GHB is also produced as a result of fermentation, and is found in small quantities in some beers and wines, beef and small citrus fruits. Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is a disease that causes GHB to accumulate in the blood.Part of this pathway was inspired by Edition 5, Chapter 24 (Fig.24.2) of the book of Blau (ISBN 9783030677268) (Ed.4 Chapter 5, Fig. 5.3).		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4159	GABA receptor signaling		GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS. It is synthesized from glutamate by the enzyme L-glutamic acid decarboxylase. The GABA transporter GAT, located in the plasma membrane of nerve terminals and glial cells, plays an important role in the termination of synaptic transmission. GABA enters the cell via GAT and is then converted to gamma hydroxybutarate or succinate, the latter eventually entering the citrate cycle.There are three GABA receptors: GABA(A), GABA(B) and GABA(C) receptor. GABA(A) and GABA(C) receptors belong to the family of transmitter-gated ion channels while GABA(B) receptor is a G protein coupled receptor which is activated by baclofen. GABA(A) receptors are hetero-oligomeric Cl- channels that are modulated by barbiturates and benzodiazepines. GABA(A)R-associated protein (GABARAP) is localized in the golgi and plays a role in intracellular GABA (A) receptor transport via its ability to interact with N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) and gephyrin (GPHN). Surface receptor number is important since it is a determinant of inhibitory synapse strength. It is controlled by removal of receptors from the membrane by interaction with the clathrin adaptor AP2 followed by recruitment into clathrin-coated pits. GABA(A) receptors can then be targeted for proteasomal degradation.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4159 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4174	Metabolism of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)		Pathway visualizing part of THC metabolism. Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, also named delta1-tetrahydrocannabinol), is the primary hallucinogenic constituent of Cannabis sativa (plant) a.k.a. marijuana. Different parts of the plant contain varying concentrations of THC, with leaves containing <1% to 10% THC by weight, and hashish, a resin prepared from the flowering tops, containing approximately 15% THC. This drug undergoes various transformation in the Phase I (mainly hepatic metabolism primarily by hydroxylation), after which several metabolites can be transformed via Phase II reactions (such as acyl glucuronidatization).THC possesses activity at benzodiazepine, opioid, and cannabinoid receptors and also exerts effects on prostaglandin synthesis, DNA, RNA, and protein metabolism. Furthermore, THC work on the two types of cannabinoidreceptor that exist in the human body — CB1 and CB2 — and these receptors are the primary targets of endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids). THC binds to both cannabinoid receptors. The CB1 receptor is mostly foundin the brain, while the CB2 receptor is found in immune tissues such as the spleen, thymus, and tonsils (but not in the brain). Specific antagonists exist for each of the CB1 and CB2 receptors.Cannabinoid-coupled G protein–coupled receptors are involved in the control of many processes, including metabolic regulation, craving, pain, anxiety, bone growth, and immune function.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4186	Somatroph axis (GH) and its relationship to dietary restriction and aging		The somatotrophic axis in mammals comprises the growth hormone (GH), which is produced by the anterior pituitary, and its secondary mediator, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). The intracellular signaling pathway of IGF-1 is the same as that elicited by insulin, which informs cells of the presence of glucose. For this reason, IGF-1 and insulin signaling are known as the insulin and IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway. Remarkably, the IIS pathway is the most conserved aging-controlling pathway in evolution, and among its multiple targets are the FOXO family of transcription factors and the mTOR complexes, which are also involved in aging and conserved through evolution. Genetic polymorphisms or mutations that reduce the functions of GH, IGF-1 receptor, insulin receptor, or downstream intracellular effectors such as AKT, mTOR, and FOXO have been linked to longevity.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4191	Caloric restriction and aging		Caloric restriction leads to a decrease in the ATP/AMP ratio, thereby activating the key nutrient sensor of the body: AMPK. AMPK then blocks mTOR function, as mTOR has an important role in regulating the balance between cell growth and autophagy, nutrient decrease leads to the induction of autophagy. AMPK stimulates NAMPT function and PGC-1a release. NAMPT converts nicotinamide to nicotinamide mononucleotide for NAD+ synthesis. PGC-1a is the regulator of mitochondrial biosynthesis (increasing mitochondrial cell mass to produce more ATP) which thus will increase if more PGC-1a is released.Levels of NAD rise during caloric restriction leading to increased SIRT1 activity. SIRT1 blocks the Insulin/IGF-1 pathway. This is a very complex and paradoxal tissue, which need further investigation/research.Increased SIRT1 activity leads to activation of FOXO/p53 genes. FOXOs become phosphorylated by AKT and this may attenuate apoptotic stimuli and reduce antioxidative stress expression.In the end these effects result in increased stress resistance and improved lifespan and health span.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4191 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4194	Hormonal control of pubertal growth spurt		This pathway shows the regulation and action of the GH-IGF-1 axis. Chondrogenesis in the growth plate is the biological process that drives height gain. The Growth hormone (GH) insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) axis is one of many regulatory systems that control chondrogenesis. Other hormones (estrogens, androgens), paracrine factors, extracellular matrix molecules and intracellular proteins regulate the activity of growth plate chondrocytes as well. Estrogen is critical for epiphyseal fusion in both young women, as well as men. This pathway describes how the growth plate lengthens until the epypheseal plate closure occurs. GH is released by the anterior pituitary gland due to the GRH. This activates IGF-1 in muscles and bones, and promotes lengthening of the growth plate. Also, GnRH in the hypothalamus stimulates LH and FSH in the anterior pituitary which stimulate gonads to produce sex hormones, such as estrogen.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4205	MET in type 1 papillary renal cell carcinoma		MET activation by its ligand HGF induces MET kinase catalytic activity, which triggers transphosphorylation of Tyr1234 and Tyr1235. These two tyrosines engage various signal transducers, thus initiating a whole spectrum of biological activities driven by MET, collectively known as the invasive growth program; proliferation and survival (resistance to apoptotic signals), increased cell motility, cell dissociation (scattering), epithelial tubulogenesis, infiltration of tissues, and stimulation of angiogenesis (Appleman et al). The transducers interact with the intracellular multisubstrate docking site of MET either directly, such as GRB2, SHC, SRC, and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, or indirectly through the scaffolding protein GAB1.Phosphorylation of Tyr1349 and Tyr1356 of the multisubstrate docking site mediates interaction with GAB1, SRC, and SHC, while only Tyr 1356 is involved in the recruitment of GRB2, phospholipase C γ (PLC-γ), p85, and SHP2. GAB1 is a key coordinator of the cellular responses to MET and binds the MET intracellular region with high avidity, but low affinity. Upon interaction with MET, GAB1 becomes phosphorylated on several tyrosine residues which, in turn, recruit a number of signaling effectors, including PI3K, SHP2, and PLC-γ. GAB1 phosphorylation by MET results in a sustained signal that mediates most of the downstream signaling pathways. (Description adapted from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-Met Wikipedia]).MET is a proto-oncogene, meaning that regulated expression of the wild-type allele plays a role in normal physiologic processes, and malignant transformation occurs when MET activity is increased in- appropriately and/or constitutively activated (Appleman et al).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4206	Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma pathway		Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) is an autosomal dominant hereditary cancer syndrome in which affected individuals are at risk for the development of cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas and kidney cancer. HLRCC is characterized by germline mutation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) enzyme, fumarate hydratase (FH). FH-deficient kidney cancer is characterized by impaired oxidative phosphorylation and a metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis, a form of metabolic reprogramming referred to as the Warburg effect. AMPK is a negative regulator of the Warburg effect in Fumarate hydratase-deficient kidney cancer. Fumarate hydratase (FH)-deficient kidney cancer, characterized by impaired oxidative phosphorylation, and undergoes a metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis to generate ATP required for the increased energetic demands of rapidly proliferating cells. The increased glycolysis suppresses expression and activation of AMPK which results in increased S6 and ACC activity, promoting anabolic growth and proliferation. Decreased AMPK results in decreased p53 and the iron transporter, DMT1. The iron responsive proteins, IRP1 and IRP2, as well as the IRP target, transferrin receptor protein 1 (TFRC) are elevated, indicating that cytosolic iron concentrations decrease secondary to decreased DMT1 activity. Prolyl hydroxylase, which is sensitive to iron levels, would be inhibited by decreased cytosolic iron levels, stabilizing HIF1α. Fumarate, which increases in FH- deficient cells, has been shown to inhibit prolyl hydroxylase, which would lead to further stabilization of HIF1α, increasing transcription of factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the glucose transporter, GLUT1. Increased fumarate has been shown to succinate KEAP1, thus altering it's conformation and disrupting its ability to induce degradation of Nrf2. Nrf2 transcription is increased activating anti-oxidant response and protecting against oxidative stress. Increased HIF1α would stimulate LDHA, increasing lactate production, and would stimulate PDK1, which inhibits PDH and would decrease entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle. FH-deficient kidney cancer use a glutamine- dependent reductive carboxylation rather than rather than oxidative metabolism for citrate formation (red arrows). Glutamine is the major source for the increased fatty acid synthesis required for rapid proliferation in these cells with disabled normal oxidative phosphorylation. Potential approaches for treatment of this aggressive form of kidney cancer include agents that stimulate AMPK, agents that target the tumor vasculature and glucose transport, agents that inhibit LDHA and agents that target the critical glutamine-dependent reductive fatty acid/lipid synthetic pathway.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4210	Tryptophan catabolism leading to NAD+ production		Scheme of mammalian tryptophan catabolism. Briefly, in mammalian cells, tryptophan is used mostly for protein synthesis. In a second quantitatively important pathway (driven by IDO in most cell types and by TDO more specifically in liver cells), it is the starting point of the kynurenine pathway. The kynurenine pathway gives birth to several metabolites, providing the appropriate enzymes that metabolize the various kynurenine intermediates are expressed. The main route of the kynurenine pathway leads to the formation of N -formyl kynurenine, L -kynurenine, 3-hydroxykynurenine, 3-hydroxyanthra- nilic acid, quinolinic acid, nicotinic acid, and in fine nicotinamine adenine dinucleotides. Additional lateral branches of the kynurenine pathway lead to the formation of other terminal kynurenines, such as KA, xanthurenic acid, and anthranilic acid. Kynurenines indicated in boldface type ( i.e. L -kynurenine and KA) correspond to the most abundant kynurenines found in caput epididymal tissue. Outside the kynurenine pathway, tryptophan is also the precursor of serotonin and melatonin. A very small proportion of tryptophan is also transformed into indol derivatives, such as indoxyl acetic acid. Conversion of Trp to N -formyl kynurenine is achieved via IDO and/or TDO. The kynurenine pathway can lead to the intracellular NAD+ production and consumption. De novo synthesis begins with the conversion of tryptophan to quinolate, which is converted to NaMN. NaMN is then adenylylated to form nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD+), which is converted to NAD+. NAD+-consuming enzymes break the bond between the Nam and ADP-ribosyl moieties. Nam, which is also provided in the diet, is salvaged to NMN, which is adenylylated to form NAD+. Na, which is provided in the diet and, potentially, by bacterial degradative pathways in vertebrates, is salvaged to form NaMN. NR, which occurs extracellularly in blood and milk and can be provided in the diet, is salvaged to NMN. Na and Nam are also converted to nicotinuric acid and N-methylnicotinamide elimination products.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4216	Chromosomal and microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer 		CRC arises from the colorectal epithelium as a result of the accumulation of genetic alterations in defined oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSG). Two major mechanisms of genomic instability have been identified in sporadic CRC progression. The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as  microsatellite instability (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2 by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX. Hereditary syndromes have germline mutations in specific genes (mutation in the tumour suppressor gene APC on chromosome 5q in FAP, mutated DNA mismatch repair genes in HNPCC).This pathway is based on information from [http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?map05210 KEGG]The most common mutation in colon cancer is inactivation of APC. When APC does not have an inactivating mutation, frequently there are activating mutations in β-catenin. In order for cancer to develop, both alleles must be mutated. Mutations in APC or β-catenin must be followed by other mutations to become cancerous; however, in carriers of an APC inactivating mutations, the risk of colorectal cancer by age 40 is almost 100%.The impact of KRAS mutations is heavily dependent on the order of mutations. Primary KRAS mutations generally lead to a self-limiting hyperplastic or borderline lesion, but if they occur after a previous APC mutation it often progresses to cancer. KRAS mutation is predictive of a very poor response to panitumumab and cetuximab therapy in colorectal cancer. Currently, the most reliable way to predict whether a colorectal cancer patient will respond to one of the EGFR-inhibiting drugs is to test for certain “activating” mutations in the gene that encodes KRAS, which occurs in 30%–50% of colorectal cancers. Studies show patients whose tumors express the mutated version of the KRAS gene will not respond to cetuximab or panitumumab. Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRAS#Colorectal_cancer Wikipedia]DCC can be considered a conditional tumor suppressor gene as well as a conditional oncogene. When DCC is present and not activated by netrin it is proapoptotic, and represses tumor formation. When DCC is present and netrin-activated it promotes cell survival, acting as an oncoprotein. One of the most frequent genetic abnormalities that occur in advanced colorectal cancer is loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of DCC in region 18q21. Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deleted_in_Colorectal_Cancer Wikipedia][https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25736321 de Miranda et al] suggest that TGFβ signaling remains active in some CRC cells with MSI mutations in the TGFBR2 gene, because the mutated gene still expresses a functional protein. Aberrant overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is thought to have an important role in development of CRC. The tumorigenic effects of COX-2 can be attributed to the production of PGE2; increased levels of PGE2 have been reported in colorectal adenomas as well as carcinomas. COX-2 and PGE2 regulate proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion in colorectal tumors. Source: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20420946 Pino et al].

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4217	Ebola virus infection in host		The Ebola virus (EBOV) pathway represents the virus infection on humans, depicted from the left to the right of the picture. The initial targets are macrophages and dendritic cells, but the virus has tropism to infect all kinds of cells, with the exception of lymphocytes. Here we represent all cells in general within one diagram.Ebola attaches to the plasma membrane and after that, a viral glycoprotein induces penetration by endocytosis. This process is made by membrane proteins. During the penetration, its particles travel in compartments where viral glycoproteins are cleaved and fused to the endosomal membrane, which results in the uncoating of viral particles into the cell's cytoplasm. The virus then begins replicating and down-regulating the host's immune response. During the release process, the newly-created viruses are released from host cells, either by causing them to break apart, by waiting for their death, or by budding off through their membrane. Depending on the type of infected cell some trans-infection could happen. This pathway was built using a text-mining approach to obtain interactions between genes related to this process. To our knowledge, it is the first comprehensive pathway depicting the Ebola pathway to date.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4220	Neurotransmitter disorders		Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers which mediate, amplify, or modulate synaptic transmissions between neurons, meaning that many are involved in primary brain functions such as movement, pain threshold, memory, and so on. The are various disorders associated with neurotransmitter dysfunction, which may also be caused by defects in the neurotransmitter transporters. This pathway describes various defects including deficiencies of tyrosine hydrolyse (TH), aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), dopamine Beta-Hydroxylase (DBH), monoamine oxidase A, as well as the heredity dopamine transporter syndrome and the brain dopamine-serotonin vesicular transporter (VMAT2) disease.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4223	Ras signaling		Ras proteins are small GTPases and are involved in transmitting signals within cells. In this way, Ras signaling controls many downstream processes, including cell proliferation, survival, growth, migration and differentiation. Ras proteins exists in two states, inactive while bound to GDP and active while bound to GTP. The exchange of GTP for GDP on RAS proteins is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Activated RAS regulates cellular functions through a set of effector molecules, including Raf, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Ral guanine nucleotide-dissociation stimulator (RALGDS).Mutations in Ras genes can lead to the production of permanently activated Ras proteins. Because these signals result in cell growth and division, overactive Ras signaling can ultimately lead to cancer. The 3 Ras genes in humans (HRas, KRas, and NRas) are the most common oncogenes in human cancer; mutations that permanently activate Ras are found in 20% to 25% of all human tumors and up to 90% in certain types of cancer.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4225	Pyrimidine metabolism and related diseases		Overview of pyrimidine metabolism and related diseases. Pyrimidine metabolism is important for the synthesis of thymine, cytosine and uracil, some of the building blocks for DNA and RNA and they also have functions in signal transduction and energy transport. The pathway can be split up in 3 parts, one is the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines, starting with glutamine and ending at UMP. From here the UMP can either be used in the nucleic acid synthesis (up) or broken down to Beta-alanine or (S)-beta-aminoisobutyrate.Disorders in the metabolism of pyrimidine are mostly caused by enzyme defects (highlighted in pink, one disease is depicted in orange, since there appears to be no clinical difference between type 2 and 1 of orotic aciduria, therefore researchers believe that type 2 does not exist officially). The clinical presentation of pyrimidine disorders is very diverse, because of the diversity in biological function. The severity of the disorder is determined by the severity of the defect and the function of the normal enzyme. Metabolic markers are highlighted in dark purple. Complexes mentioned in pathway are pictured in bottom left corner. The link to the Urea cycle is depicted for clarity.This pathway was inspired by Chapter 41 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4228	Vitamin B6-dependent and responsive disorders		Vitamine B6 is absorbed in different vitamers, which undergo several (de)phosphorylation steps, to be able to pas the blood-brain barrier. Within the brain, PLP (Pyridoxal-P) is the only active cofactor for intracellular enzyme reactions. PLP catalyses over 100 reactions, mainly related to amino acids and neurotransmitter metabolism. Bold lines in the Figure show how the major source of PLP is divided in the body.A number of genetic defects have been identified as the underlying cause of vitamine B6 dependent epilepsies, particularly occurring in the neonatal life stage, which could lead to irreversible brain damage or could be fatal. The disorders related to this pathway can be divided in two categories: reduced production/availability of PLP or inactivation of PLP by formation of Knoevenagel products.Specific biomarkers from urine, plasma or Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) exist to distinguish the disorders.Oral treatment with PL or PLP is available, as well as intrauterine treatment with vitamine B6 for mothers in the early stages of pregnancy.This pathway was inspired by Ed. 5 Chapter 34 of the book of Blau (ISBN 9783030677268) (ed.4 Chapter 11).		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4239	Epithelial to mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer		Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process during which cells lose their epithelial characteristics, and gain mesenchymal properties, such as increased motility. In colorectal cancer (CRC), EMT is associated with an invasive or metastatic phenotype. During EMT, tumor cells undergo tight junction dissolution, disruption of apical–basal polarity, and reorganization of the cytoskeletal architecture, which enable cells to develop an invasive phenotype. In cancer cells, EMT is abnormally regulated by extracellular stimuli derived from the tumor microenvironment, including growth factors and inflammatory cytokines, along with intra-tumoral physical stresses such as hypoxia. Therefore, EMT programming allows tumor cells to adapt to the constant changes of the human tumor microenvironment, and thus to successfully metastasize. This pathway summarizes the major signaling pathways and inducers that promote EMT in CRC. A set of core transcription factors regulate EMT: SNAIL family of zinc-finger transcription factors SNAIL/SLUG; the zinc finger E-box binding homeobox (ZEB) family of transcription factors ZEB1/ZEB2, and the TWIST family of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors TWIST1/TWIST2.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4240	Regulation of sister chromatid separation at the metaphase-anaphase transition		In prometaphase, highly condensed chromosomes establish bipolar attachments to the mitotic spindle. Unattached or mal-orientated chromosomes generate a signal to delay the onset of anaphase until all pairs of sister chromatids are properly aligned on the metaphase plate. This signal is transduced by a relay of spindle-checkpoint proteins, including MAD1, MAD2, BUB1, BUBR1, BUB3 and centrosome protein E (CENPE), which inhibits cell division cycle 20 (CDC20)-mediated activation of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Following attachment and alignment of all the chromosomes at metaphase, the checkpoint signal is silenced and APC/C initiates the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of securin and activation of separase. Separase in turn cleaves a multiprotein complex termed cohesin, which creates physical links between sister chromatids to initiate anaphase.This process may be of interest in colorectal cancer, specifically in terms of the chromosome instability phenotype, which could result from defects in pathways that ensure accurate chromosome segregation.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4262	Breast cancer pathway		Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: * Luminal A subtype: Hormone receptor positive (progesterone and estrogen) and HER2 (ERBB2) negative* Luminal B subtype: Hormone receptor positive (progesterone and estrogen) and HER2 (ERBB2) positive * HER2 positive: Hormone receptor negative (progesterone and estrogen) and HER2 (ERBB2) positive* Basal-like or triple-negative (TNBCs): Hormone receptor negative (progesterone and estrogen) and HER2 (ERBB2) negative Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumors, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signaling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10% incidence across all breast cancers.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4263	Pancreatic adenocarcinoma pathway		Infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy of the pancreas. When most investigators use the term 'pancreatic cancer' they are referring to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Normal duct epithelium progresses to infiltrating cancer through a series of histologically defined precursors, Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PanINs: https://pathology.jhu.edu/pancreas/professionals/DuctLesions.php). The overexpression of HER-2/neu (ERBB2) and activating point mutations in the K-ras gene occur early, inactivation of the p16 gene (CDKN2A) at an intermediate stage, and the inactivation of p53, SMAD4, and BRCA2 occur relatively late. Activated K-ras engages multiple effector pathways. Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Moreover, PDA shows extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes. Inactivation of the SMAD4 tumor suppressor gene leads to loss of the inhibitory influence of the transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway.The progression of disease and associated mutations is defined based on the arrow at the top, from left to right.Phosphorylation sites were added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus (R), www.phosphosite.org.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP428	Wnt signaling		Wnt proteins are secreted morphogens that are required for basic developmental processes, such as cell-fate specification, progenitor-cell proliferation and the control of asymmetric cell division, in many different species and organs. There are at least three different Wnt pathways: the canonical pathway, the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway and the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway. In the canonical Wnt pathway, the major effect of Wnt ligand binding to its receptor is the stabilization of cytoplasmic beta-catenin through inhibition of the bea-catenin degradation complex. Beta-catenin is then free to enter the nucleus and activate Wnt-regulated genes through its interaction with TCF (T-cell factor) family transcription factors and concomitant recruitment of coactivators. Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling leads to the activation of the small GTPases RHOA (RAS homologue gene-family member A) and RAC1, which activate the stress kinase JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase) and ROCK (RHO-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1) and leads to remodelling of the cytoskeleton and changes in cell adhesion and motility. WNT-Ca2+ signalling is mediated through G proteins and phospholipases and leads to transient increases in cytoplasmic free calcium that subsequently activate the kinase PKC (protein kinase C) and CAMKII (calcium calmodulin mediated kinase II) and the phosphatase calcineurin.Source: [http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/hsa/hsa04310.html KEGG].

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4281	Cholesterol biosynthesis, regulation and transport		Cholesterol is an animal sterol that can be found in its free or storage form in plasma, or within body tissues such as the liver, spinal cord and brain. (1) The storage form of cholesterol, known as cholesteryl ester, is formed through an ester bond between a fatty acid carboxylate group and the hydroxyl group of cholesterol. (1) Cholesterol is essential for the maintenance of stability within animal cell membranes and acts as a precursor for the biosynthesis of Vitamin D and bile acids. (3) It is also necessary for the synthesis of pregnenolone, which in turn, is a precursor for all steroid hormones- including glucocorticoids, estrogens, progesterones,  androgens and aldosterone. (3) Another key role of cholesterol is within neuronal physiology; it is essential for synapse and dendrite development, and forms a major component of myelin. (4)          Biosynthesis and regulation Given the essentiality of cholesterol in the body, all cells are capable of its biosynthesis from acetyl-CoA via a complex, multistep process occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosolic compartments. (1) Generally, over half the cholesterol in the body (approximately 700 mg/d) arises thorough this endogenous biosynthesis, with 20% of this cholesterol being synthesised in the liver and intestine. (1) The remainder is sourced from the consumption of animal-derived foods in the diet. (1) Regulation cholesterol biosynthesis relies on cholesterol levels within the cell. (6)Maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis is critical for cell survival and homeostatic disturbances may lead to disease. (7) - Membrane bound transcription factors SREBPs (sterol regulatory element binding proteins) regulate de novo cholesterol synthesis. Two genes in the human genome encode 3 SREBP isoforms: SREBP-1a, SREBP 1c/ADD1 and SREBP-2. (6) Activation of SREBPs and thus the biosynthesis of cholesterol is mediated by SCAP (SREBP cleavage activating protein), which acts as a cholesterol sensor in the cell. (6) - In cholesterol-replete cells, SREBP is bound to SCAP, forming the SREBP-SCAP complex. (6) The complex is bound to Insig, a resident protein on the endoplasmic reticulum whose expression is induced by insulin. (6) Through this sequestration of the SREBP-SCAP complex to the endoplasmic reticulum, cholesterol biosynthesis is inhibited. (6)- When SCAP senses depleted cholesterol levels within the cell, the SCAP-SREBP complex dissociates from Insig, and moves towards the Golgi apparatus. (6) Two proteolytic cleavage events, mediated by site 1 (S1P) and site 2 (S2P) proteases that are activated by SCAP in low-cholesterol environments, enable the the release of SREBP from the membrane. (6)- Released SREBP travels to the nucleus and binds to sterol regulatory element (SRE) sequences in target gene promotor regions to stimulate their transcription. (6) Target genes include low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and HMG-CoA reductase. (6) The former plays a key role in scavenging low-density lipoproteins (primary cholesterol carriers) in the blood, while the latter is necessary for endogenous cholesterol synthesis. (6) At the synthesis level, HMG-CoA may also inhibit cholesterol production if the sterol-sensing domain of the enzyme detects cholesterol levels to be high. (6) This is mediated by the sterol-regulated binding of HMG-CoA to Insig, which promotes the enzyme's ubiquitylation and proteosomal degredation. (6)          Transport Cholesterol, predominately in its esterified form, is transported between tissues in lipoproteins. (1) Lipoproteins facilitate the transport of cholesterol and cholesteryl esters via emulsification; i.e. the spherical lipoprotein unit contains a nonpolar core of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides, surrounded by an amphiphathic layer of phospholipids, apoproteins and small amounts of non-esterified cholesterol. (7) Different types of lipoproteins are classified according to their increasing levels of density. (botham) These include chylomicrons, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL). (7) One or more apolipoproteins (known as Apo A, Apo B, Apo C etc.) are present in each lipoprotein, and contribute to the differentiation, structure and enzymatic activity of the various lipoproteins. (botham) Apolipoproteins also act as ligands for the binding of lipoproteins to tissue lipoprotein receptors, which facilitates the uptake of lipids by cells. (1)Dietary cholesterol and other lipids, including free fatty acids and triglycerides, are packaged in chylomicrons for transport out of the intestine. (7) Ultimately, triglycerides are transferred to muscle and adipose tissue, and this is followed by the transfer of cholesterol to the liver via chylomicron remnants. (7) Chylomicron remnants, high in cholesteryl esters, are formed following the removal of the lipoproteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s triglyceride core. (7) The uptake of chylomicron remnants by the liver is facilitated by the binding of Apo E to specific receptors located only on hepatic cells. (7) In the liver, chylomicron remnants are catabolised by lysosomes, leading to the liberation of cholesterol; this cholesterol may either be excreted from the body via bile acids, or incorporated into VLDL for transport alongside biosynthesised cholesterol to peripheral tissues. (7) In the circulation, VLDL is eventually converted into remnant VLDL particles, then into LDL particles, which are cholesterol rich and contain approximately 75% of all plasma cholesterol. (7) It is LDL particles that ultimately bind to specific LDL tissue receptors to provide a supply of cholesterol to peripheral tissues. (6) Such tissues include the adrenal glands, skeletal muscle, lymphocytes, gonads and kidneys. (6)		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4286	Genotoxicity pathway		"This pathway describes the transcriptomic biomarker TGx-DDI genotoxicity assay (consisting of 64 genes) developed to readily distinguish DNA damage-inducing (DDI) agents from non-DDI agents. Abstract from the paper ""Development and validation of a high-throughput transcriptomic biomarker to address 21st century genetic toxicology needs"" by Li et al. (2017) published in PNAS:Standard in vitro assays to assess genotoxicity frequently generate positive results that are subsequently found to be irrelevant for in vivo carcinogenesis and human cancer risk assessment. Currently used follow-up methods, such as animal testing, are expensive and time-consuming, and the development of approaches enabling more accurate mechanism-based risk assessment is essential. We developed an in vitro transcriptomic biomarker-based approach that provides a robust biomarker reflecting stress-signaling responses. The biomarker correctly identifies the vast majority of irrelevant genotoxicity results from in vitro chromosome damage assays. TGx-DDI, a multigene biomarker for DNA damage-inducing agents, is the first biomarker that not only shows convincing interlaboratory and intralaboratory reproducibility, but also performs accurately in a system suitable for high-throughput screening."		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4297	Thiamine metabolic pathways		Thiamine is absorbed in the form of thiamine or thiamine monophosphate and transported through the plasma membrane by thiamine transporter 1 (THTR1) and thiamine transporter 2 (THTR2), which are encoded for by the genes SLC19A2 and SLC19A3, respectively. Upon cell entrance, thiamine undergoes pyrophosphorylation by thiamine pyrophosphokinase (TPK) to thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). TPP is the active form of thiamine and serves as a cofactor of transketolase in the pentose phosphate pathway in the cytosol. TPP also functions as a cofactor for pyruvate, ketoglutarate and branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenases in the mitochondrion after entrance via TPP transporter encoded by SLC25A19. This pathway was inspired by Chapter 15 (Thiamine Disorders) of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4299	Lamin A-processing pathway		All lamins, except lamin C, contain a CaaX tail. This tail is comprised of respectively cysteine, two aliphatic amino acids and any amino acid with a COOH-terminal (variable). Aliphatic amino acids are nonpolar and hydrophobic and include glycine, alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine. This structure acts as recognition point for a sequence of modifications. First the terminal cysteine is farnesylated by farnesyl transferase, where a isoprenyl group is added to the cysteine residue -also called isoprenylation. This is followed by proteolytic cleavage of the aaX part by Zmpste24 and methylation (CH3) of cysteine. Isoprenylation and methylation are both necessary for the localization of lamin A and B-type lamins in to the INM. Until this point processing of lamin A and type-B lamins is similar. While in type-B lamins the isoprenyl group remains attached to the cysteine, lamin A has a second cleavage site to cleave off an additional 15 amino acids upstream of the cysteine. This cleavage is also done by Zmpste24 and takes place at INM. When these 15 amino acids, 18 in total including aaX, are cleaved off mature lamin A is produced (1,2). Lamin processing is involved in progeria.		9606

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced from accumulated iron and lipid peroxidation (regulated by GrX4 and 15-LO). Ferroptosis is important in several physiological and pathological processes, including cancer cell death, mitochondrial dysfunction induced epilepsy and neurodegenerative disease. Ferroptosis can be induced to treat multiple forms of cancer by inhibiting tumor growth, although the exact mechanism is unknown. Ferroptosis has also been linked to neurodegenerative disease, possibly through increased inflammation caused by release of lipid metabolites.Description adapted from [https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+hsa04216 KEGG] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferroptosis Wikipedia].		9606

These electrons enter the electron transport chain of the mitochondria via reduction equivalents to generate ATP. The shuttle system is required because the mitochondrial inner membrane is impermeable to NADH, the primary reducing equivalent of the electron transport chain.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4357	NRF2-ARE regulation		Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered to the cytoplasm through binding with Keap1/Cul3/RBX1 and continually degraded via the proteasome. On early response to external stressors, Keap1 is oxidized or Nrf2 is phosphorylated by PKC. Nrf2 then translocates into the nucleus and binds to ARE (antioxidant-responsive) genes in order to increase or decrease transcription. A delayed response to external stressors causes phosphorylation of GSK-3β (by unknown tyrosine kinases), GSK-3β then activates Src kinases, which then translocate to the nucleus. Src kinases phosphorylate Nrf2 (Tyr568) which allows for nuclear export, ubiquitination and degradation of Nrf2. If insulin receptor signaling is initiated, GSK-3β activity is inhibited. Keap1 is also able to regulate Nrf2 activity through sequestration with PGAM5 to the mitochondria. In addition, PI3K also phosphorylates the CEBPB, inducing its translocation to the nucleus where it binds to the CEBPB response element within the xenobiotic response element, in conjunction with NRF2 binding to ARE.Description was adapted from Fig 1 in Vomhof-Dekrey et al, and Fig 4 in Surh et al.Protein phosphorylation sites were added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus (R), www.phosphosite.org.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP437	EGF/EGFR signaling pathway		Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) also known as ErbB1/HER1 is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases which also includes ErbB2 (Neu, HER2), ErbB3 (HER3) and ErbB4 (HER4). Several ligands such as epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha, epigen, amphiregulin, betacellulin, heparin-binding EGF and epiregulin are known to specifically bind to EGFR. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is one of the high affinity ligands of EGFR. EGF/EGFR system induces growth, differentiation, migration, adhesion and cell survival through various inter-acting signaling pathways. The binding of EGF to the extracellular domain of EGFR induces the dimerization, activation of intrinsic kinase activity and subsequent autophosphorylation of EGFR at multiple residues in the cytoplasmic region such as Tyr 1092, Tyr 1172, Tyr 1197, Tyr 1110, Tyr 1016). Activated EGFR recruits various cytoplasmic proteins which transduce and regulate the EGFR function. The proteins recruited to active EGFR include many Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain containing proteins which binds to the tyrosine phosphorylated residues in EGFR, enzymes which act on EGFR and also various EGFR substrates. One of the adapter proteins, GRB2, binds to the phosphotyrosine residue at 1068 and recruits SOS to the membrane. SOS activates GDP/GTP exchange which recruits RAF to the membrane. RAF phosphorylates MEKs, which then activates the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK). ERK activates a number of transcriptional regulators to induce cell growth and proliferation. GRB2 or other adaptor proteins such as GABs recruits PI3Ks, another major mediator of EGFR signaling. PI3Ks convert Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 binds to PH domain of AKT and recruits it to plasma membrane. PDK1 phosphorylates AKT which in turn regulate the activity of various proteins that mediate cell survival. EGFR also activate phospholipase C which hydrolyses PIP2 to generate Inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and 1,2-Diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 induces the release of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum to activate calcium regulated pathways. DAG activates protein kinase C pathway. One of the signaling modules regulated by PKC in EGFR pathway is the NFKB module. The protein SRC is a key player in the activation of various pathways such as RAS, PLC and also the STAT proteins in various cells. Other signaling modules activated by EGFR include the FAK, JNK, p38MAPK and ERK5 modules. EGFR induces the JNK pathway through the activation of G proteins such as RAC and CDC42 which recruits JNK kinases as well as regulate the actin polymerization.  EGFR also translocates from the plasma  membrane to other cellular compartments including nucleus where it directly regulate the expression of several genes in cooperation with other transcriptional regulators such as STATs, PCNA and E2F family of proteins. Being a growth, differentiation and cell survival factor; mutations and overexpression of EGFR and also the defective regulation of its signal transduction pathways has been established to be associated with oncogenesis. Thus, EGFR and its signaling components are promising targets for effective therapy for various cancers. There are several proteins which have been reported to regulate the EGFR signaling such as CBL, CSK, PKC and PTEN which promotes endocytosis or reduction in the EGFR activity or its signaling mediators. The major endocytic pathway of EGFR is established to be the clathrin coated pits which delivers them to endosomes. The endosomal pathway recycles the membraneous form of EGFR or form multivesicular bodies (MVB) and fuse with lysosomes for to the degradation pathway.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/EGFR1_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite the following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP438	Non-homologous end joining		"Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a pathway that repairs double-strand breaks in DNA. NHEJ is referred to as ""non-homologous"" because the break ends are directly ligated without the need for a homologous template, in contrast to homologous recombination, which requires a homologous sequence to guide repair. NHEJ involves binding of the KU heterodimer to double-stranded DNA ends, recruitment of DNA-PKcs (MRX complex in yeast), processing of ends, and recruitment of the DNA ligase IV (LIG4)-XRCC4 complex, which brings about ligation.NHEJ typically utilizes short homologous DNA sequences called microhomologies to guide repair. These microhomologies are often present in single-stranded overhangs on the ends of double-strand breaks. When the overhangs are perfectly compatible, NHEJ usually repairs the break accurately. Imprecise repair leading to loss of nucleotides can also occur, but is much more common when the overhangs are not compatible. Inappropriate NHEJ can lead to translocations and telomere fusion, hallmarks of tumor cells. NHEJ is evolutionarily conserved throughout all kingdoms of life and is the predominant double-strand break repair pathway in mammalian cells.Adapted from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-homologous_end_joining Wikipedia], [https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+hsa03450 KEGG] and [http://repairtoire.genesilico.pl/Pathway/8/ REPAIRtoire].This pathway is part the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP438 CPTAC Assay Portal]."		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4389	Bile acids synthesis and enterohepatic circulation 		Bile Acid Synthesis and Enterohepathic Circulation. In hepatocytes, cholesterol is acquired through de novo synthesis as well as receptor-mediated endocytosis of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins. Cholesterol is eliminated through bile acid synthesis and secretion. The first (and rate-limiting) step in cholesterol conversion  to bile acids is catalyzed by CYP7A1. Bile acids are then secreted into the bile via ABCB11 and released into the small intestine. The majority of bile acids are re-absorbed into the enterocytes via ASBT and transported back to the liver via portal circulation via NTCP.  In the hepatocyte, bile acids activate FXR, which inhibits CYP7A1. In the small intestine, bile acids also activate FXR to induce FGF15, which subsequently binds and activates FGFR4, leading to inhibition of CYP7A1, partially via ERK signaling.Based on figure 1 in [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29653253 Wang et al].		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4397	Model for regulation of MSMP expression in cancer cells and its proangiogenic role in ovarian tumors		Proposed model for regulation of MSMP expression in cancer cells under hypoxic conditions and the proangiogenic role of MSMP in ovarian tumors.The recruitment of the transcriptional repressor CTCF to the MSMP enhancer region is regulated by changes in H3 acetylation of the MSMP enhancer. In hypoxic conditions, the repressor-enhancer binding is disrupted, leading to increased expression of MSMP. Secretion of MSMP triggers MAPK signaling in endothelial cells (presumably via CCR2 signaling), which promotes angiogenesis. This suggests that MSMP inhibition in combination with antiangiogenesis drugs (anti-VEGF) could be a new strategy to overcome resistance to antiangiogenesis therapy.Description adapted from Mitamura et al.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4404	Interleukin-15 signaling		The high affinity Interleukin-15 receptor is a heterotrimer of Interleukin-15 receptor subunit alpha (IL15RA), Interleukin-2 receptor subunit beta (IL2RB, CD122) and Cytokine receptor common subunit gamma (IL2RG, CD132). IL2RB and IL2RG are also components of the Interleukin-2 (IL2) receptor. Treatment of human T cells with Interleukin-15 (IL15) results in tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1 (JAK1, Janus kinase 1) and Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK3 (JAK3, Janus kinase 3) (Johnston et al. 1995, Winthrop 2017). IL15 can signal by a process termed 'trans presentation', where IL15 bound by IL15 on one cell is trans-presented to IL2RB:IL2RG on another cell (Dubois et al. 2002) but can also participate in more 'traditional' cis signaling (Wu et al. 2008, Mishra et al. 2014) where all the three receptors are present on the same cell. Stimulation of lymphocytes by IL15 release MAPK activation through GAB2/SHP2/SHC (GRB2-associated-binding protein 2/Tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 11/SHC transforming protein 1 or 2) cascade activation (Gadina et al. 2000).

The activated IL9R complex recruits tyrosine kinase proteins from the Janus kinase (JAK) family: JAK1 (JAK1) and JAK3 (JAK3) for subsequent activation of the Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) factors STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4413	Transcriptional regulation by E2F6		E2F6, similar to other E2F proteins, possesses the DNA binding domain, the dimerization domain and the marked box. E2F6, however, does not have a pocket protein binding domain and thus does not interact with the retinoblastoma family members RB1, RBL1 (p107) and RBL2 (p130) (Gaubatz et al. 1998, Trimarchi et al. 1998, Cartwright et al. 1998). E2F6 lacks the transactivation domain and acts as a transcriptional repressor (Gaubatz et al. 1998, Trimarchi et al. 1998, Cartwright et al. 1998). E2F6 forms a heterodimer with TFDP1 (DP-1) (Trimarchi et al. 1998, Ogawa et al. 2002, Cartwright et al. 1998) or TFDP2 (DP-2) (Gaubatz et al. 1998, Trimarchi et al. 1998, Cartwright et al. 1998).<p>E2f6 knockout mice are viable and embryonic fibroblasts derived from these mice proliferate normally. Although E2f6 knockout mice appear healthy, they are affected by homeotic transformations of the axial skeleton, involving vertebrae and ribs. Similar skeletal defects have been reported in mice harboring mutations in polycomb genes, suggesting that E2F6 may function in recruitment of polycomb repressor complex(es) to target promoters (Storre et al. 2002).<p>E2F6 mediates repression of E2F responsive genes. While E2F6 was suggested to maintain G0 state in quiescent cells (Gaubatz et al. 1998, Ogawa et al. 2002), this finding has been challenged (Giangrande et al. 2004, Bertoli et al. 2013, Bertoli et al. 2016). Instead, E2F6-mediated gene repression in proliferating (non-quiescent) cells is thought to repress E2F targets involved in G1/S transition during S phase of the cell cycle. E2F6 does not affect E2F targets involved in G2/M transition (Oberley et al. 2003, Giangrande et al. 2004, Attwooll et al. 2005, Trojer et al. 2011, Bertoli et al. 2013). In the context of the E2F6.com-1 complex, E2F6 was shown to bind to promoters of E2F1, MYC, CDC25A and TK1 genes (Ogawa et al. 2002). E2F6 also binds the promoters of CDC6, RRM1 (RR1), PCNA and TYMS (TS) genes (Giangrande et al. 2004), as well as the promoter of the DHFR gene (Gaubatz et al. 1998). While transcriptional repression by the E2F6.com 1 complex may be associated with histone methyltransferase activity (Ogawa et al. 2002), E2F6 can also repress transcription independently of H3K9 methylation (Oberley et al. 2003).<p>During S phase, E2F6 is involved in the DNA replication stress checkpoint (Bertoli et al. 2013, Bertoli et al. 2016). Under replication stress, CHEK1-mediated phosphorylation prevents association of E2F6 with its target promoters, allowing transcription of E2F target genes whose expression is needed for resolution of stalled replication forks and restart of DNA synthesis. Inability to induce transcription of E2F target genes (due to CHEK1 inhibition or E2F6 overexpression) leads to replication stress induced DNA damage (Bertoli et al. 2013, Bertoli et al. 2016). E2F6 represses transcription of a number of E2F targets involved in DNA synthesis and repair, such as RRM2, RAD51, BRCA1, and RBBP8 (Oberley et al. 2003, Bertoli et al. 2013).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4414	Regulation of RUNX2 expression and activity		Several transcription factors have been implicated in regulation of the RUNX2 gene transcription. Similar to the RUNX1 gene, the RUNX2 gene expression can be regulated from the proximal P2 promoter or the distal P1 promoter (reviewed in Li and Xiao 2007).<br>Activated estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) binds estrogen response elements (EREs) in the P2 promoter and stimulates RUNX2 transcription (Kammerer et al. 2013). Estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRA) binds EREs or estrogen-related response elements (ERREs) in the P2 promoter of RUNX2. When ERRA is bound to its co-factor PPARG1CA (PGC1A), it stimulates RUNX2 transcription. When bound to its co-factor PPARG1CB (PGC1B), ERRA represses RUNX2 transcription (Kammerer et al. 2013).<br>TWIST1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, stimulates RUNX2 transcription by binding to the E1-box in the P2 promoter (Yang, Yang et al. 2011). TWIST proteins also interact with the DNA-binding domain of RUNX2 to modulate its activity during skeletogenesis (Bialek et al. 2004). Schnurri-3 (SHN3) is another protein that interacts with RUNX2 to decrease its availability in the nucleus and therefore its activity (Jones et al. 2006). In contrast, RUNX2 and SATB2 interact to enhance the expression of osteoblast-specific genes (Dobreva et al. 2006). Formation of the heterodimer with CBFB (CBF-beta) also enhances the transcriptional activity of RUNX2 (Kundu et al. 2002, Yoshida et al. 2002, Otto et al. 2002).<br>Transcription of RUNX2 from the proximal promoter is inhibited by binding of the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) activated by dexamethasone (DEXA) to a glucocorticoid receptor response element (GRE), which is also present in the human promoter (Zhang et al. 2012).<br>NKX3-2 (BAPX1), required for embryonic development of the axial skeleton (Tribioli and Lufkin 1999), binds the distal (P1) promoter of the RUNX2 gene and inhibits its transcription (Lengner et al. 2005). RUNX2-P1 transcription is also autoinhibited by RUNX2-P1, which binds to RUNX2 response elements in the P1 promoter of RUNX2 (Drissi et al. 2000). In contrast, binding of RUNX2-P2 to the proximal P2 promoter autoactivates transcription of RUNX2-P2 (Ducy et al. 1999). Binding of a homeodomain transcription factor DLX5, and possibly DLX6, to the RUNX2 P1 promoter stimulates RUNX2 transcription (Robledo et al. 2002, Lee et al. 2005). The homeobox transcription factor MSX2 can bind to DLX5 sites in the promoter of RUNX2 and inhibit transcription of RUNX2-P1 (Lee et al. 2005).<br>Translocation of RUNX2 protein to the nucleus is inhibited by binding to non-activated STAT1 (Kim et al. 2003).<br>Several E3 ubiquitin ligases were shown to polyubiquitinate RUNX2, targeting it for proteasome-mediated degradation: FBXW7a (Kumar et al. 2015), STUB1 (CHIP) (Li et al. 2008), SMURF1 (Zhao et al. 2003, Yang et al. 2014), WWP1 (Jones et al. 2006), and SKP2 (Thacker et al. 2016).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4415	Transcriptional regulation by RUNX2		RUNX2 (CBFA1 or AML3) transcription factor, similar to other RUNX family members, RUNX1 and RUNX3, can function in complex with CBFB (CBF-beta) (Kundu et al. 2002, Yoshida et al. 2002, Otto et al. 2002). RUNX2 mainly regulates transcription of genes involved in skeletal development (reviewed in Karsenty 2008). RUNX2 is involved in development of both intramembraneous and endochondral bones through regulation of osteoblast differentiation and chondrocyte maturation, respectively. RUNX2 stimulates transcription of the BGLAP gene (Ducy and Karsenty 1995, Ducy et al. 1997), which encodes Osteocalcin, a bone-derived hormone which is one of the most abundant non-collagenous proteins of the bone extracellular matrix (reviewed in Karsenty and Olson 2016). RUNX2 directly controls the expression of most genes associated with osteoblast differentiation and function (Sato et al. 1998, Ducy et al. 1999, Roce et al. 2005). RUNX2-mediated transcriptional regulation of several genes involved in GPCR (G protein coupled receptor) signaling is implicated in the control of growth of osteoblast progenitors (Teplyuk et al. 2009). RUNX2 promotes chondrocyte maturation by stimulating transcription of the IHH gene, encoding Indian hedgehog (Takeda et al. 2001, Yoshida et al. 2004). Germline loss-of-function mutations of the RUNX2 gene are associated with cleidocranial dysplasia syndrome (CCD), an autosomal skeletal disorder (reviewed in Jaruga et al. 2016). The function of RUNX2 is frequently disrupted in osteosarcoma (reviewed in Mortus et al. 2014). Vitamin D3 is implicated in regulation of transcriptional activity of the RUNX2:CBFB complex (Underwood et al. 2012).<p>RUNX2 expression is regulated by estrogen signaling, and RUNX2 is implicated in breast cancer development and metastasis (reviewed in Wysokinski et al. 2014). Besides estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRA) (Kammerer et al. 2013), RUNX2 transcription is also regulated by TWIST1 (Yang, Yang et al. 2011), glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) (Zhang et al. 2012), NKX3-2 (BAPX1) (Tribioli and Lufkin 1999, Lengner et al. 2005), DLX5 (Robledo et al. 2002, Lee et al. 2005) and MSX2 (Lee et al. 2005). RUNX2 can autoregulate, by directly inhibiting its own transcription (Drissi et al. 2000). Several E3 ubiquitin ligases target RUNX2 for proteasome-mediated degradation: FBXW7a (Kumar et al. 2015), STUB1 (CHIP) (Li et al. 2008), SMURF1 (Zhao et al. 2003, Yang et al. 2014), WWP1 (Jones et al. 2006), and SKP2 (Thacker et al. 2016). Besides formation of RUNX2:CBFB heterodimers, transcriptional activity of RUNX2 is regulated by binding to a number of other transcription factors, for example SOX9 (Zhou et al. 2006, TWIST1 (Bialek et al. 2004) and RB1 (Thomas et al. 2001).<p>RUNX2 regulates expression of several genes implicated in cell migration during normal development and bone metastasis of breast cancer cells. RUNX2 stimulates transcription of the ITGA5 gene, encoding Integrin alpha 5 (Li et al. 2016) and the ITGBL1 gene, encoding Integrin beta like protein 1 (Li et al. 2015). RUNX2 mediated transcription of the MMP13 gene, encoding Colagenase 3 (Matrix metalloproteinase 13), is stimulated by AKT mediated phosphorylation of RUNX2 (Pande et al. 2013). RUNX2 is implicated in positive regulation of AKT signaling by stimulating expression of AKT-activating TORC2 complex components MTOR and RICTOR, which may contribute to survival of breast cancer cells (Tandon et al. 2014).<p>RUNX2 inhibits CDKN1A transcription, thus preventing CDKN1A-induced cell cycle arrest. Phosphorylation of RUNX2 by CDK4 in response to high glucose enhances RUNX2-mediated repression of the CDKN1A gene in endothelial cells (Pierce et al. 2012). In mice, Runx2-mediated repression of Cdkn1a may contribute to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Kuo et al. 2009). RUNX2 can stimulate transcription of the LGALS3 gene, encoding Galectin-3 (Vladimirova et al. 2008, Zhang et al. 2009). Galectin 3 is expressed in myeloid progenitors and its levels increase during the maturation process (Le Marer 2000).<p>For a review of RUNX2 function, please refer to Long 2012 and Ito et al. 2015.

Family C GPCRs have a large extracellular N-terminus which binds the orthosteric (endogenous) ligand. The shape of this domain is often likened to a clam.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4421	Signaling by Retinoic Acid		Vitamin A (retinol) can be metabolised into active retinoid metabolites that function either as a chromophore in vision or in regulating gene expression transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. Genes regulated by retinoids are essential for reproduction, embryonic development, growth, and multiple processes in the adult, including energy balance, neurogenesis, and the immune response. The retinoid used as a cofactor in the visual cycle  is 11-cis-retinal (11cRAL). The non-visual cycle effects of retinol are mediated by retinoic acid (RA), generated by two-step conversion from retinol (Napoli 2012).  All-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) is the major activated metabolite of retinol. An isomer, 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA) has biological activity, but has not been detected in vivo, except in the pancreas. An alternative route involves BCO1 cleavage of carotenoids into retinal, which is then reduced into retinol in the intestine (Harrison 2012). The two isomers of RA serve as ligands for  retinoic acid receptors (RAR) that regulate gene expression. (Das et al. 2014). RA is catabolised to oxidised metabolites such as 4-hydroxy-, 18-hydroxy-  or 4-oxo-RA by CYP family enzymes, these metabolites then becoming substrates for Phase II conjugation enzymes (Ross & Zolfaghari 2011).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4422	G alpha (z) signaling events		The heterotrimeric G protein G alpha (z), is a member of the G (i) family. Unlike other G alpha (i) family members it lacks an ADP ribosylation site cysteine four residues from the carboxyl terminus and is thus pertussis toxin-insensitive. It inhibits adenylyl cyclase types I, V and VI (Wong Y H et al. 1992). G alpha (z) interacts with the Rap1 GTPase activating protein (Rap1GAP) to attenuate Rap1 signaling. Like all G-proteins G alpha (z) has an intrinsic GTPase activity, but this activity tends to be lower for the pertussis toxin insensitive G-proteins, most strikingly so for G alpha (z), whose kcat value for GTP hydrolysis is 200-fold lower than those of G alpha (s) or G alpha (i) (Grazziano et al. 1989). G alpha (z) knockout mice have disrupted platelet aggregation at physiological concentrations of epinephrine and responses to several neuroactive drugs are altered (Yang et al. 2000). Regulator of G-protein Signalling (RGS) proteins can regulate the activity of G alpha (z) (Soundararajan M et al. 2008).

Other functions of G alpha (i) includes activation of the protein tyrosine kinase c-Src (Ma Y C et al. 2000).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4424	G alpha (q) signaling events		The classic signalling route for G alpha (q) is activation of phospholipase C beta thereby triggering phosphoinositide hydrolysis, calcium mobilization and protein kinase C activation. This provides a path to calcium-regulated kinases and phosphatases, GEFs, MAP kinase cassettes and other proteins that mediate cellular responses ranging from granule secretion, integrin activation, and aggregation in platelets. Gq participates in many other signalling events including direct interaction with RhoGEFs that stimulate RhoA activity and inhibition of PI3K. Both in vitro and in vivo, the G-protein Gq seems to be the predominant mediator of the activation of platelets. Moreover, G alpha (q) can stimulate the activation of Burton tyrosine kinase (Ma Y C et al. 1998). Regulator of G-protein Signalling (RGS) proteins can regulate the activity of G alpha (z) (Soundararajan M et al. 2008).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4426	G alpha (12/13) signaling events		The G12/13 family is probably the least well characterized subtype, partly because G12/13 coupling is difficult to determine when compared with the other subtypes which predominantly rely on assay technologies that measure intracellular calcium. The G12/13 family are best known for their involvement in the processes of cell proliferation and morphology, such as stress fiber and focal adhesion formation. Interactions with Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs)  are thought to mediate many of these processes. (Buhl et al.1995, Sugimoto et al. 2003). Activation of Rho or the regulation of events through Rho is often taken as evidence of G12/13 signaling. Receptors that are coupled with G12/13 invariably couple with one or more other G protein subtypes, usually Gq.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4427	G alpha (s) signaling events		The general function of the G alpha (s) subunit (Gs) is to activate adenylate cyclase (Tesmer et al. 1997), which in turn produces cAMP, leading to the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinases (often referred to collectively as Protein Kinase A). The signal from the ligand-stimulated GPCR is amplified because the receptor can activate several Gs heterotrimers before it is inactivated.

COPII-coated vesicles were originally discovered in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using genetic approaches coupled with a cell-free assay. The mammalian counterpart of this pathway is represented here. Newly synthesized proteins destined for secretion are sorted into COPII-coated vesicles at specialized regions of the ER.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4431	Integrin signaling		Integrins are a major family of cell surface receptors that modulate cell adhesion, migration, proliferation and survival through interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the actin cytoskeleton.  Integrins are type 1 transmembrane proteins that exist at the cell surface as heterodimers of alpha and beta subunits, of which there are 18 and 8 different isoforms, respectively, in human cells. In addition to their mechanical role in mediating contact between the ECM and the cytoskeleton, integrins also modulate intracellular signaling pathways governing cytoskeletal rearrangements and pro-survival and mitogenic signaling (reviewed in Hehlgans et al, 2007; Harburger and Calderwood, 2009; Ata and Antonescu, 2017). <br>In this pathway, we describe signaling through integrin alphaIIb beta3 as a representative example.<br>At the sites of vascular injury bioactive molecules such as thrombin, ADP, collagen, fibrinogen and thrombospondin are generated, secreted or exposed. These stimuli activate platelets, converting the major platelet integrin alphaIIbbeta3 from a resting state to an active conformation, in a process termed integrin priming or 'inside-out signalling'. Integrin activation refers to the change required to enhance ligand-binding activity. The activated alphaIIbbeta3 interacts with the fibrinogen and links platelets together in an aggregate to form a platelet plug. AlphaIIbbeta3 bound to fibrin generates more intracellular signals (outside-in signalling), causing further platelet activation and platelet-plug retraction. <br>In the resting state the alpha and beta tails are close together.  This interaction keeps the membrane proximal regions in a bent conformation that maintains alphaIIbbeta3 in a low affinity state. <br>Integrin alphaIIbbeta3 is released from its inactive state by interaction with the protein talin. Talin interacts with the beta3 cytoplasmic domain and disrupts the salt bridge between the alpha and beta chains. This separation in the cytoplasmic regions triggers the conformational change in the extracellular domain that increases its affinity to fibrinogen. <br>Much of talin exists in an inactive cytosolic pool, and the Rap1 interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) is implicated in talin activation and translocation to beta3 integrin cytoplasmic domain.<br> View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=354192 Reactome].		9606

Estrogens bind estrogen receptors, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Ligand-bound estrogen receptors act as nuclear transcription factors to regulate expression of genes that control cellular proliferation and differentiation, among other processes, but also play a non-genomic role in rapid signaling from the plasma membrane (reviewed in Hah et al, 2014;Schwartz et al, 2016).

Mice lacking Tysnd1 have reduced peroxisomal localization of some peroxisomal enzymes and exhibit reduced beta-oxidation of fatty acids and metabolism of phytanic acid (Mizuno et al. 2013).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4434	Synthesis of Lipoxins (LX)		Lipoxins A4 (LXA4) and B4 (LXB4), structurally characterized from human neutrophils incubated with 15-hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HpETE), each contain three hydroxyl moieties and a conjugated tetraene. The third hydroxyl of LXA4 is positioned at C-6, and of LXB4 at C-14.  The action of arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5), in concert with an arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12) or arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15) activity, has been shown to produce lipoxins by three distinct pathways.  Neutrophil ALOX5 can produce and secrete leukotriene A4 (LTA4) that is taken up by platelets, where it is acted upon by ALOX12 to form lipoxins. Likewise, ALOX15s can generate either 15-hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HpETE) or 15-hydro-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) that can be taken up by monocytes and neutrophils, where highly expressed ALOX5 uses it to generate lipoxins. Finally, aspirin acetylated prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 (PTGS2), rendered unable to synthesize prostaglandins, can act as a 15-lipoxygenase. This leads to the formation of 15R-HETE and culminates in creation of epi-lipoxins, which have altered stereochemistry at the C-15 hydroxyl but similar biological potency (Chiang et al. 2006, Buczynski et al. 2009, Vance & Vance 2008, Stsiapanava et al. 2017).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4436	Signaling by NTRK2 (TRKB)		NTRK2 (TRKB) belongs to the family of neurotrophin tyrosine kinase receptors, also known as NTRKs or TRKs. Besides NTRK2, the family includes NTRK1 (TRKA) and NTRK3 (TRKC). Similar to other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), NTRK2 is activated by ligand binding to its extracellular domain. Ligand binding induces receptor dimerization, followed by trans-autophosphorylation of dimerized receptors on conserved tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic region. Phosphorylated tyrosines in the intracellular domain of the receptor serve as docking sites for adapter proteins, triggering downstream signaling cascaded. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4 (NTF4, also known as NT-4) are two high affinity ligands for NTRK2. Neurotrophin-3 (NTF3, also known as NT-3), a high affinity ligand for NTRK3, binds to NTRK2 with low affinity and it is not clear if it the low level of activation of NTRK2 by NTF3 plays a physiologically relevant role. Nerve growth factor (NGF), a high affinity ligand for NTRK1, does not interact with NTRK2. NTRK2 activation triggers downstream RAS, PI3K, and PLCgamma signaling cascades, thought to be involved in neuronal development in both the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS). In addition, NTRK2 plays an important, but poorly elucidated, role in long-term potentiation (LTP) and learning (reviewed by Minichiello 2009). NTRK2 may modify neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission by directly phosphorylating voltage gated channels (Rogalski et al. 2000).<p><p>It was recently demonstrated that the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN12 negatively regulates NTRK2 signaling and neurite outgrowth. In the presence of PTPN12, NTRK2 phosphorylation at tyrosine Y816 decreases. It has not yet been demonstrated that PTPN12 acts directly to dephosphorylate Y816 (and possibly other phosphotyrosines) of NTRK2 (Ambjorn et al. 2013).<p><p>Binding of SH2D1A (SAP) to NTRK2 attenuates NTRK2 trans autophosphorylation and downstream signaling through an unknown mechanism (Lo et al. 2005).<p><p>Little is known about downregulation of NTRK2 (TRKB) receptor via ubiquitin dependent pathways (Sanchez Sanchez and Arevalo 2017). CBL, a ubiquitin ligase involved in degradation of many receptor tyrosine kinases, was shown to ubiquitinate and, unexpectedly, increase stability of NTRK2 (Pandya et al. 2014). NTRK2 undergoes ubiquitination by the TRAF6 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. While ubiquitination by the TRAF6 complex negatively regulates NTRK2 induced AKT activation, the effect of TRAF6 mediated ubiquitination on NTRK2 protein levels has not been examined (Jadhav et al. 2008).<p><p>Downregulation of the TRKB receptor may depend on the activating ligand, with BDNF inducing more rapid ubiquitination and degradation compared to NTF4 (NT 4). NTRK2 undergoes both lysosome dependent and proteasome dependent degradation upon stimulation by BDNF, while stimulation by NTF4 may protect NTRK2 from the lysosome degradation route (Proenca et al. 2016).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4437	Signaling by PTK6		PTK6 (BRK) is an oncogenic non-receptor tyrosine kinase that functions downstream of ERBB2 (HER2) (Xiang et al. 2008, Peng et al. 2015) and other receptor tyrosine kinases, such as EGFR (Kamalati et al. 1996) and MET (Castro and Lange 2010). Since ERBB2 forms heterodimers with EGFR and since MET can heterodimerize with both ERBB2 and EGFR (Tanizaki et al. 2011), it is not clear if MET and EGFR activate PTK6 directly or act through ERBB2. Levels of PTK6 increase under hypoxic conditions (Regan Anderson et al. 2013, Pires et al. 2014). The kinase activity of PTK6 is negatively regulated by PTPN1 phosphatase (Fan et al. 2013) and SRMS kinase (Fan et al. 2015), as well as the STAT3 target SOCS3 (Gao et al. 2012).<p>PTK6 activates STAT3-mediated transcription (Ikeda et al. 2009, Ikeda et al. 2010) and may also activate STAT5-mediated transcription (Ikeda et al. 2011). PTK6 promotes cell motility and migration by regulating the activity of RHO GTPases RAC1 (Chen et al. 2004) and RHOA (Shen et al. 2008), and possibly by affecting motility-related kinesins (Lukong and Richard 2008). PTK6 crosstalks with AKT1 (Zhang et al. 2005, Zheng et al. 2010) and RAS signaling cascades (Shen et al. 2008, Ono et al. 2014) and may be involved in MAPK7 (ERK5) activation (Ostrander et al. 2007, Zheng et al. 2012). PTK6 enhances EGFR signaling by inhibiting EGFR down-regulation (Kang et al. 2010, Li et al. 2012, Kang and Lee 2013). PTK6 may also enhance signaling by IGF1R (Fan et al. 2013) and ERBB3 (Kamalati et al. 2000).<p>PTK6 promotes cell cycle progression by phosphorylating and inactivating CDK inhibitor CDKN1B (p27) (Patel et al. 2015).<p>PTK6 activity is upregulated in osteopontin (OPN or SPP1)-mediated signaling, leading to increased VEGF expression via PTK6/NF-kappaB/ATF4 signaling path. PTK6 may therefore play a role in VEGF-dependent tumor angiogenesis (Chakraborty et al. 2008).<p>PTK6 binds and phosphorylates several nuclear RNA-binding proteins, including SAM68 family members (KHDRSB1, KHDRSB2 and KHDRSB3) (Derry et al. 2000, Haegebarth et al. 2004, Lukong et al. 2005) and SFPQ (PSF) (Lukong et al. 2009).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4438	Biosynthesis of DPA-derived SPMs		Docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), a C22:5 long-chain Ï‰3 or Ï‰6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), is found in algal and fish oils, created via linoleic acid metabolism and is a metabolite in DHA metabolism. It can be acted upon by lipoxygenases to produce mono-, di- and tri-hydroxy derivatives in neutrophils and macrophages. These DPA derivatives are another branch of the specialised proresolving mediators (SPMs) produced from long-chain fatty acids which have anti-inflammatory properties, even though mechanisms of their anti-inflammatory action have not been fully elucidated (Bannenberg & Serhan 2010, Dangi et al. 2010, Vik et al. 2017, Hansen et al. 2017).<br><br>The biosynthesis of SPMs derived from the two isomers of DPA, DPAn-6 (cis-4,7,10,13,16-docosapentaenoic acid) and DPAn-3 (cis-7,10,13,16,19-docosapentaenoic acid), is described here. The only difference between the two isomers is the position of the first double bond; Ï‰-3 for DPAn-3 and Ï‰-6 for DPAn-6. The products of these isomers were characterised by analogy in structure and action to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-derived and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-derived resolvins, protectins and maresins (Serhan et al. 2002, Bannenberg & Serhan 2010, Serhan et al. 2015).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4439	Biosynthesis of DHA-derived SPMs		Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a major Ï‰-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) found in fish oil is the source of D-series resolvins (RvDs), one of the specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) that show potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving actions (Molfino et al. 2017). The biosynthesis of RvDs occurs mainly during the process of inflammation when endothelial cells interact with leukocytes. Dietary DHA circulates in plasma or is present in cellular membranes as it can easily integrate into membranes. On injury or infection, DHA moves with edema into the tissue sites of acute inflammation where it is converted to exudate RvDs to interact with local immune cells (Kasuga et al. 2008). The initial transformation of DHA by aspirin-acetylated cyclooxygenase-2 or cyclooxygenase-mediated catalysis can produce stereospecific D-resolvins (18(R)- or 18(S)-RvDs respectively). Combinations of oxidation, reduction and hydrolysis reactions determine the type of D-resolvin formed (RvD1-6) (Serhan et al. 2002, Serhan & Petasis 2011, Serhan et al. 2014).

The biosynthesis of RvEs occurs mainly during the process of inflammation when endothelial cells interact with leukocytes. EPA, circulating in plasma or released/mobilised from damaged cellular membranes on injury or infection, moves with edema into the tissue sites of acute inflammation where it is converted to exudate RvEs to interact with local immune cells (Kasuga et al. 2008).

The ERGIC concentrates COPII-derived cargo from the ER for further anterograde transport to the cis-Golgi and also recycles resident ER proteins back to the ER through retrograde traffic.  Both of these pathways appear to make use of microtubule-directed COPI-coated vesicles (Pepperkok et al, 1993; Presley et al, 1997; Scales et al, 1997; Stephens and Pepperkok, 2002; Stephens et al, 2000; reviewed in Lord et al, 2001; Spang et al, 2013).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4442	Peroxisomal protein import		Peroxisomes are small cellular organelles that are bounded by a single membrane and contain variable compositions of proteins depending on cell type. Peroxisomes function in oxidation of fatty acids, detoxification of glyoxylate, and synthesis of plasmalogens, glycerophospholipids containing an alcohol with a vinyl-ether bond (reviewed in Lohdi and Semenkovich 2014). All of the approximately 46 proteins contained in peroxisomal matrix are imported from the cytosol by a unique mechanism that does not require the imported proteins to be unfolded as they cross the membrane (Walton et al. 1995, reviewed in Ma et al. 2011, Fujiki et al. 2014, Baker et al. 2016, Dias et al 2016, Emmanoulidis et al. 2016, Erdmann 2016, Francisco et al. 2017). The incompletely characterized process appears to involve the transport of the proteins through a variably sized pore in the membrane comprising at least PEX5 and PEX14 (inferred from the yeast homologs in Meinecke et al. 2010, the yeast pore is reviewed in Meinecke et al. 2016). Oligomeric proteins are also observed to cross the peroxisomal membrane (Otera and Fujiki 2012) but their transport appears to be less efficient than monomeric proteins (Freitas et al. 2011, inferred from mouse homologs in Freitas et al. 2015, reviewed in Dias et al. 2016).<br>In the cytosol, receptor proteins, PEX5 and PEX7, bind to specific sequence motifs in cargo proteins (Dodt et al. 1995, Wiemer et al. 1995, Braverman et al. 1997). The long and short isoforms of PEX5 (PEX5L and PEX5S) bind peroxisome targeting sequence 1 (PTS1, originally identified in firefly luciferase by Gould et al. 1989) found on most peroxisomal matrix proteins; PEX7 binds PTS2 (originally identified in rat 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase by Swinkels et al. 1991) found on 3 imported proteins thus far in humans. The long isoform of PEX5, PEX5L, then binds the PEX7:cargo protein complex (Braverman et al. 1998, Otera et al. 2000). PEX5S,L bound to a cargo protein or PEX5L bound to PEX7:cargo protein then interacts with a complex comprising PEX13, PEX14, PEX2, PEX10, and PEX12 at the peroxisomal membrane (Gould et al. 1996, Fransen et al. 1998, inferred from rat homologs in Reguenga et al. 2001).<br>The ensuing step in which the cargo protein is translocated across the membrane is not completely understood. During translocation, PEX5 and PEX7 become inserted into the membrane (Wiemer et al. 1995, Dodt et al. 1995, Oliveira et al. 2003) and expose a portion of their polypeptide chains to the organellar matrix (Rodrigues et al. 2015). One current model envisages PEX5 as a plunger that inserts into a transmembrane barrel formed by PEX14, PEX13, PEX2, PEX10, and PEX12 (the Docking-Translocation Module) (Francisco et al. 2017).<br>After delivering cargo to the matrix, PEX5 and PEX7 are recycled back to the cytosol by a process requiring mono-ubiquitination of PEX5 and ATP hydrolysis (Imanaka et al. 1987, Thoms and Erdmann 2006, Carvalho et al. 2007). PEX7 is not ubiquitinated but its recycling requires PEX5 mono-ubiquitination. A subcomplex of the Docking-Translocation Module comprising the RING-finger proteins PEX2, PEX10, and PEX12 conjugates a single ubiquitin to a cysteine residue of PEX5 (Carvalho et al. 2007, reviewed in Platta et al. 2016). The mono-ubiquitinated PEX5 and associated PEX7 are then extracted by the exportomer complex consisting of PEX1, PEX6, PEX26, and ZFAND6 (inferred from rat homologs in Miyata et al. 2012). PEX1 and PEX6 are members of the ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities (AAA) family, a group of proteins that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to remodel molecular complexes. PEX1 and PEX6 form a hetero-hexameric ring, best described as a trimer of PEX1/PEX6 dimers (inferred from yeast in Platta et al. 2005, yeast homologs reviewed in Schwerter et al. 2017). Data on the yeast PEX1:PEX6 complex suggest that these ATPases use a substrate-threading mechanism to disrupt protein-protein interactions (Gardner et al. 2018). PEX7 is also then returned to the cytosol (Rodrigues et al. 2014). Once in the cytosol, ubiquitinated PEX5 is enzymatically deubiquitinated by USP9X and may also be non-enzymatically deubiquitinated by nucleophilic attack of the thioester bond between ubiquitin and the cysteine residue of PEX5 by small metabolites such as glutathione (Grou et al. 2012).<br>Defects in peroxisomal import cause human diseases: Zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile Refsum disease and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata types 1 and 5 (BarÃ¸y et al. 2015, reviewed in Nagotu et al. 2012, Braverman et al. 2013, Wanders 2014, Fujiki 2016, Waterham et al. 2016).

NGF binding to p75NTR activates a number of downstream signalling events controlling survival, death, proliferation, and axonogenesis, according to the cellular context. p75NTR is devoid of enzymatic activity, and signals by recruiting other proteins to its own intracellular domain. p75 interacting proteins include NRIF, TRAF2, 4, and 6, NRAGE, necdin, SC1, NADE, RhoA, Rac, ARMS, RIP2, FAP and PLAIDD. Here we annotate only the proteins for which a clear involvement in p75NTR signalling was demonstrated.<br>A peculiarity of p75NTR is the ability to bind the pro-neurotrophins proNGF and proBDNF. Proneurotrophins do not associate with TRK receptors, whereas they efficiently signal cell death by apoptosis through p75NTR. The biological action of neurotrophins is thus regulated by proteolytic cleavage, with proforms preferentially activating p75NTR, mediating apoptosis, and mature forms activating TRK receptors, to promote survival. Moreover, the two receptors are utilised to differentially modulate neuronal plasticity. For instance, proBDNF-p75NTR signalling  facilitates LTD, long term depression, in the hippocampus (Woo NH, et al, 2005), while BDNF-TRKB signalling promotes LTP (long term potentiation). Many biological observations indicate  a functional interaction between p75NTR and TRKA signaling pathways. <br> View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=193704 Reactome].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4444	Biosynthesis of electrophilic omega-3 PUFA oxo-derivatives		Electrophilic oxo-derivatives of Ï‰-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Ï‰-3 PUFAs) are generated in macrophages and neutrophils in response to inflammation and oxidative stress to promote the resolution of inflammation. Being electrophilic, these derivatives reversibly bind to nucleophilic residues on target proteins (thiolates of cysteines and amino groups of histidine and lysine), triggering the activation of cytoprotective pathways. These include the Nrf2 antioxidant response, the heat shock response and the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor Î³ (PPARÎ³) and suppressing the NF-ÎºB proinflammatory pathway (Cipollina 2015). Thus, these electrophilic derivatives transduce anti-inflammatory actions rather than suppress the production of pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid metabolites. An oxo-derivative of EPA has been shown to ablate leukemia stem cells in mice, which may represent a novel chemoprotective action for some oxo-derivatives (Hedge et al. 2011, Finch et al. 2015). In humans, dietary supplementation with Ï‰-3 PUFAs has been reported to increase the formation of oxo-derivatives (Yates et al. 2014). The enzymes cyclooxygenases (COX), lipoxygenases (LOs) and cytochromes P450s, acting alone or in concerted transcellular biosynthesis, initially form epoxy or hydroxy intermediates of Ï‰-3 PUFAs docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPAn-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) before these are further oxidised to electrophilic Î±,Î²-unsaturated keto-derivatives by cellular dehydrogenases.

SUMOylation of transcription cofactors usually inhibits the activity of the cofactor (reviewed in Girdwood et al. 2004, Gill 2005, Lyst and Stancheva 2007, Garcia-Dominguez and Reyes 2009).

In all but a few cases (notably AR and RORA) SUMOylation causes transcriptional repression. Repression by SUMOylation is believed to occur through several mechanisms: interference with DNA binding, recruitment of corepressors, retention of corepressors at non-target promoters (transrepression), re-localization of nuclear receptors within the nucleus, interference with dimerization of receptors, and interference (crosstalk) with other post-translational modifications.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4452	Signaling by NTRK3 (TRKC)		NTRK3 (TRKC) belongs to the family of neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinases, which also includes NTRK1 (TRKA) and NTRK2 (TRKB). Neurotrophin-3 (NTF3, also known as NT-3) is the ligand for NTRK3. Similar to other NTRK receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases in general, ligand binding induces receptor dimerization followed by trans-autophosphorylation on conserved tyrosines in the intracellular (cytoplasmic) domain of the receptor (Lamballe et al. 1991, Philo et al. 1994, Tsoulfas et al. 1996, Yuen and Mobley 1999, Werner et al. 2014). These conserved tyrosines serve as docking sites for adaptor proteins that trigger downstream signaling cascades. Signaling through PLCG1 (Marsh and Palfrey 1996, Yuen and Mobley 1999, Huang and Reichardt 2001), PI3K (Yuen and Mobley 1999, Tognon et al. 2001, Huang and Reichardt 2001, Morrison et al. 2002, Lannon et al. 2004, Jin et al. 2008) and RAS (Marsh and Palfrey 1996, Gunn-Moore et al. 1997, Yuen and Mobley 1999, Gromnitza et al. 2018), downstream of activated NTRK3, regulates cell survival, proliferation and motility.<p>In the absence of its ligand, NTRK3 functions as a dependence receptor and triggers BAX and CASP9-dependent cell death (Tauszig-Delamasure et al. 2007, Ichim et al. 2013).<p>NTRK3 was reported to activate STAT3 through JAK2, but the exact mechanism has not been elucidated (Kim et al. 2016). NTRK3 was reported to interact with the adaptor protein SH2B2, but the biological role of this interaction has not been determined (Qian et al. 1998).<p>Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases PTPRO and PTPRS (PTPsigma) negatively regulate NTRK3 signaling by dephosphorylating NTRK3 (Beltran et al. 2003, Faux et al. 2007, Hower et al. 2009, Tchetchelnitski et al. 2014). In addition to dephosphorylation of NTRK3 in-cis, the extracellular domain of pre-synaptic PTPRS can bind in-trans to extracellular domain of post-synaptic NTRK3, contributing to synapse formation (Takahashi et al. 2011, Coles et al. 2014).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4453	Transcriptional regulation by MECP2		MECP2 is an X chromosome gene whose loss-of-function mutations are an underlying cause of the majority of Rett syndrome cases. The MECP2 gene locus consists of four exons. Both exon 1 and exon 2 contain translation start sites. Alternative splicing of the second exon results in expression of two MECP2 transcript isoforms, MECP2_e1 (MECP2B or MECP2alpha) and MECP2_e2 (MECP2A or MECP2beta). The N-terminus of the MECP2_e1 isoform, in which exon 2 is spliced out, is encoded by exon 1. The N-terminus of the MECP2_e2 isoforms, which includes both exon 1 and exon 2, is encoded by exon 2, as the exon 2 translation start site is used. Exons 3 and 4 are present in both isoforms. The MECP2_e2 isoform was cloned first and is therefore more extensively studied. The MECP2_e1 isoform is more abundant in the brain (Mnatzakanian et al. 2004, Kriaucionis and Bird 2004, Kaddoum et al. 2013). Mecp2 isoforms show different expression patterns during mouse brain development and in adult brain regions (Dragich et al. 2007, Olson et al. 2014). While Rett syndrome mutations mainly occur in exons 3 and 4 of MECP2, thereby affecting both MECP2 isoforms (Mnatzakanian et al. 2004), some mutations occur in exon 1, affecting MECP2_e1 only. No mutations have been described in exon 2 (Gianakopoulos et al. 2012). Knockout of Mecp2_e1 isoform in mice, through a naturally occurring Rett syndrome point mutation which affects the first translation codon of MECP2_e1, recapitulates Rett-like phenotype. Knockout of Mecp2_e2 isoform in mice does not result in impairment of neurologic functions (Yasui et al. 2014). In Mecp2 null mice, transgenic expression of either Mecp2_e1 or Mecp2_e2 prevents development of Rett-like phenotype, with Mecp2_e1 rescuing more Rett-like symptoms than Mecp2_e2. This indicates that both splice variants can fulfill basic Mecp2 functions in the mouse brain (Kerr et al. 2012). Changes in gene expression upon over-expression of either MECP2_e1 or MECP2_e2 imply overlapping as well as distinct target genes (Orlic-Milacic et al. 2014).<p>Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 encoded by the MECP2 gene binds to methylated CpG sequences in the DNA. The binding is not generic, however, but is affected by the underlying DNA sequence (Yoon et al. 2003). MECP2 binds to DNA containing 5 methylcytosine (5mC DNA), a DNA modification associated with transcriptional repression (Mellen et al. 2012), both in the context of CpG islands and outside of CpG islands (Chen et al. 2015). In addition, MECP2 binds to DNA containing 5 hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC DNA), a DNA modification associated with transcriptional activation (Mellen et al. 2012). MECP2 binds to DNA as a monomer, occupying about 11 bp of the DNA. Binding of one MECP2 molecule facilitates binding of the second MECP2 molecule, and therefore clustering can occur at target sites. MECP2 binding to chromatin may be facilitated by nucleosome methylation (Ghosh et al. 2010).<p>MECP2 was initially proposed to act as a generic repressor of gene transcription. However, high throughput studies of MECP2-induced changes in gene expression in mouse hippocampus (Chahrour et al. 2008), and mouse and human cell lines (Orlic-Milacic et al. 2014) indicate that more genes are up-regulated than down-regulated when MECP2 is overexpressed. At least for some genes directly upregulated by MECP2, it was shown that a complex of MECP2 and CREB1 was involved in transcriptional stimulation (Chahrour et al. 2008, Chen et al. 2013).<p>MECP2 expression is the highest in postmitotic neurons compared to other cell types, with MECP2 being almost as abundant as core histones. Phosphorylation of MECP2 in response to neuronal activity regulates binding of MECP2 to DNA, suggesting that MECP2 may remodel chromatin in a neuronal activity-dependent manner. The resulting changes in gene expression would then modulate synaptic plasticity and behavior (reviewed by Ebert and Greenberg 2013). In human embryonic stem cell derived Rett syndrome neurons, loss of MECP2 is associated with a significant reduction in transcription of neuronally active genes, as well as the reduction in nascent protein synthesis. The reduction in nascent protein synthesis can at least in part be attributed to the decreased activity of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Neuronal morphology (reduced soma size) and the level of protein synthesis in Rett neurons can be ameliorated by treating the cells with growth factors which activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascade or by inhibition of PTEN, the negative regulator of AKT activation. Mitochondrial gene expression is also downregulated in Rett neurons, which is associated with a reduced capacity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (Ricciardi et al. 2011, Li et al. 2013). Treatment of Mecp2 null mice with IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) reverses or ameliorates some Rett-like features such as locomotion, respiratory difficulties and irregular heart rate (Tropea et al. 2009).<p>MECP2 regulates expression of a number of ligands and receptors involved in neuronal development and function. Ligands regulated by MECP2 include BDNF (reviewed by Li and Pozzo-Miller 2014, and KhorshidAhmad et al. 2016), CRH (McGill et al. 2006, Samaco et al. 2012), SST (Somatostatin) (Chahrour et al. 2008), and DLL1 (Li et al. 2014). MECP2 also regulates transcription of genes involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter GABA â€“ GAD1 (Chao et al. 2010) and GAD2 (Chao et al. 2010, He et al. 2014). MECP2 may be involved in direct stimulation of transcription from the GLUD1 gene promoter, encoding mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase 1, which may be involved in the turnover of the neurotransmitter glutamate (Livide et al. 2015). Receptors regulated by MECP2 include glutamate receptor GRIA2 (Qiu et al. 2012), NMDA receptor subunits GRIN2A (Durand et al. 2012) and GRIN2B (Lee et al. 2008), opioid receptors OPRK1 (Chahrour et al. 2008) and OPRM1 (Hwang et al. 2009, Hwang et al. 2010, Samaco et al. 2012), GPRIN1 (Chahrour et al. 2008), MET (Plummer et al. 2013), NOTCH1 (Li et al. 2014). Channels/transporters regulated by MECP2 include TRPC3 (Li et al. 2012) and SLC2A3 (Chen et al. 2013). MECP2 regulates transcription of FKBP5, involved in trafficking of glucocorticoid receptors (Nuber et al. 2005, Urdinguio et al. 2008). MECP2 is implicated in regulation of expression of SEMA3F (semaphorin 3F) in mouse olfactory neurons (Degano et al. 2009). In zebrafish, Mecp2 is implicated in sensory axon guidance by direct stimulation of transcription of Sema5b and Robo2 (Leong et al. 2015). MECP2 may indirectly regulate signaling by neuronal receptor tyrosine kinases by regulating transcription of protein tyrosine phosphatases, PTPN1 (Krishnan et al. 2015) and PTPN4 (Williamson et al. 2015).<p>MECP2 regulates transcription of several transcription factors involved in functioning of the nervous system, such as CREB1, MEF2C, RBFOX1 (Chahrour et al. 2008) and PPARG (Mann et al. 2010, Joss-Moore et al. 2011).<p>MECP2 associates with transcription and chromatin remodeling factors, such as CREB1 (Chahrour et al. 2008, Chen et al. 2013), the HDAC1/2-containing SIN3A co-repressor complex (Nan et al. 1998), and the NCoR/SMRT complex (Lyst et al. 2013, Ebert et al. 2013). There are contradictory reports on the interaction of MECP2 with the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex (Harikrishnan et al. 2005, Hu et al. 2006). Interaction of MECP2 with the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 has been reported, with a concomitant increase in enzymatic activity of DNMT1 (Kimura and Shiota 2003).<p>In addition to DNA binding-dependent regulation of gene expression by MECP2, MECP2 may influence gene expression by interaction with components of the DROSHA microprocessor complex and the consequent change in the levels of mature microRNAs (Cheng et al. 2014, Tsujimura et al. 2015).<p>Increased MECP2 promoter methylation is observed in both male and female autism patients (Nagarajan et al. 2008). Regulatory elements that undergo methylation are found in the promoter and the first intron of MECP2 and their methylation was shown to regulate Mecp2 expression in mice (Liyanage et al. 2013). Mouse Mecp2 promoter methylation was shown to be affected by stress (Franklin et al. 2010).<p>The Rett-like phenotype of Mecp2 null mice is reversible (Guy et al. 2007), but appropriate levels of Mecp2 expression need to be achieved (Alvarez-Saavedra et al. 2007). When Mecp2 expression is restored in astrocytes of Mecp2 null mice, amelioration of Rett symptoms occurs, involving non-cell-autonomous positive effect on mutant neurons and increasing level of the excitatory glutamate transporter VGLUT1 (Lioy et al. 2011). Microglia derived from Mecp2 null mice releases higher than normal levels of glutamate, which has toxic effect on neurons. Increased glutamate secretion may be due to increased levels of glutaminase (Gls), involved in glutamate synthesis, and increased levels of connexin-32 (Gjb1), involved in glutamate release, in Mecp2 null microglia (Maezawa and Jin 2010). Targeted deletion of Mecp2 from Sim1-expressing neurons of the mouse hypothalamus recapitulates some Rett syndrome-like features and highlights the role of Mecp2 in feeding behavior and response to stress (Fyffe et al. 2008).<p>Mecp2 overexpression, similar to MECP2 duplication syndrome, causes neurologic phenotype similar to Rett (Collins et al. 2004, Luikenhuis et al. 2004, Van Esch et al. 2005, Alvarez-Saavedra 2007, Van Esch et al. 2012). The phenotype of the mouse model of the MECP2 duplication syndrome in adult mice is reversible when Mecp2 expression levels are corrected (Sztainberg et al. 2015).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4454	Acetylcholine binding and downstream events		Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter found at neuromuscular junctions, synapses in the ganglia of the visceral motor system, and at a variety of sites within the central nervous system. A great deal is known about the function of cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular junction and at ganglionic synapses, the actions of ACh in the central nervous system are not as well understood. Acetylcholine is synthesized in nerve terminals from acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA) synthesized from glucose) and choline. This reaction is catalyzed by choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). The presence of acetyltransferase in a neuron is thus a strong indication that ACh is used as one of its transmitters. Choline is present in plasma at a concentration of about 10 mM, and is taken up into cholinergic neurons by a high affinity Na+/choline transporter. About 10,000 molecules of ACh are packaged into each neurotransmitter containing vesicle by a vesicular ACh transporter.<br>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchR) are ionotropic receptors that can be activated by nicotine and permeable to of monovalent (sodium, potassium) and divalent cations(calcium), however, the permeability of sodium and/or calcium maybe high or low depending on the subunit composition of the receptor. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are expressed widely in the central and peripheral nervous system in the presynaptic terminal, terminal bouton and post synaptic neuron. Functionally nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the pre synaptic and postsynaptic terminals behave similarly. Nicotinic AChR are a family of acetylcholine gated pentameric receptors that are formed by the association of various combinations of mostly alpha, beta subunits (for the neuronal type) and together with gamma, delta and epsilon subunits (for the muscle type). In addition, receptors may be more diverse due the fact that some receptors have same subunits but the stoichiometry of the subunits is different.

Activation of kainate receptors made from GRIK1 or KA2 release Ca2+ from the intracellular stores in a G protein-dependent manner.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4457	GABA receptor activation		Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors are the major inhibitory receptors in human synapses. They are of two types. GABA A receptors are fast-acting ligand gated chloride ion channels that mediate membrane depolarization and thus inhibit neurotransmitter release (G Michels et al Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol 42, 2007, 3-14). GABA B receptors are slow acting metabotropic Gprotein coupled receptors that act via the inhibitory action of their Galpha/Go subunits on adenylate cyclase to attenuate the actions of PKA. In addition, their Gbeta/gamma subunits interact directly with N and P/Q Ca2+ channels to decrease the release of Ca2+. GABA B receptors also interact with Kir3 K+ channels and increase the influx of K+, leading to cell membrane hyperpolarization and inhibition of channels such as NMDA receptors (A Pinard et al Adv Pharmacol, 58, 2010, 231-55).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4458	Signaling by Erythropoietin		Erythropoietin (EPO) is a cytokine that serves as the primary regulator of erythropoiesis, the differentiation of erythrocytes from stem cells in the liver of the fetus and the bone marrow of adult mammals (reviewed in Ingley 2012, Zhang et al. 2014, Kuhrt and Wojchowski 2015). EPO is produced in the kidneys in response to low oxygen tension and binds a receptor, EPOR, located on progenitor cells: burst forming unit-erythroid (BFU-e) cells and colony forming unit-erythroid (CFU-e) cells.<br>The erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) exists in lipid rafts (reviewed in McGraw and List 2017) as a dimer pre-associated with proteins involved in downstream signaling: the tyrosine kinase JAK2, the tyrosine kinase LYN, and the scaffold protein IRS2. Binding of EPO to the EPOR dimer causes a change in conformation (reviewed in Watowich et al. 2011, Corbett et al. 2016) that activates JAK2, which then transphosphorylates JAK2 and phosphorylates the cytoplasmic domain of EPOR. The phosphorylated EPOR serves directly or indirectly as a docking site for signaling molecules such as STAT5, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K), phospholipase C gamma (PLCG1, PLCG2), and activators of RAS (SHC1, GRB2:SOS1, GRB2:VAV1).<br>EPO activates 4 major signaling pathways: STAT5-activated transcription, PI3K-AKT, RAS-RAF-ERK, and PLC-PKC. JAK2-STAT5 activates expression of BCL2L1 (Bcl-xL) and therefore appears to be important for anti-apoptosis. PI3K-AKT appears to be important for both anti-apoptosis and proliferation. The roles of other signaling pathways are controversial but both RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and PLCgamma-PKC have mitogenic effects. Phosphatases such as SHP1 are also recruited and downregulate the EPO signal.<br>EPO also has effects outside of erythropoiesis. The EPOR is expressed in various tissues such as endothelium where it can act to stimulate growth and promote cell survival (Debeljak et al. 2014, KimÃ¡kovÃ¡ et al. 2017). EPO and EPOR in the neurovascular system act via Akt, Wnt1, mTOR, SIRT1, and FOXO proteins to prevent apoptotic cell injury (reviewed in  Ostrowski and Heinrich 2018, Maiese 2016) and EPO may have therapeutic value in the nervous system (Ma et al. 2016).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4459	Glutamate binding, activation of AMPA receptors and synaptic plasticity		Excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain is carried out by glutamate receptors through the activation of both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors.  Ionotropic glutamate receptors are of three subtypes based on distinct physiologic properties and their differential binding of exogenous ligands namely  NMDA (N-methyl D-aspartate), AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) and Kainate . The ionotropic receptors are glutamate gated ion channels that initiate signaling by influx of ions, and are comprised of subunits with distinct structures and distinguished based on their agonist binding. Even though all three types of receptors are found at the glutamatergic synapses yet they exhibit great diversity in the synaptic distribution. The metabotropic glutamate receptors are a family of G-protein coupled receptors that are slow acting.  Fast excitatory synaptic transmission is carried out through AMPA receptors. Post-synaptic transmission involves binding of the ligand such as glutamate/AMPA to the AMPA receptor resulting in the Na influx which causes depolarization of the membrane. NMDA receptors are blocked by Mg at resting membrane potential. NMDA receptors are activated upon coincident depolarization and glutamate binding are activated following AMPA receptor activation.NMDA receptors are blocked by Mg at resting <br>membrane potential. NMDA receptors are Ca permeable and their activity leads to increase in Ca which, leads to upregulation of AMPA receptors at the synapse which causes the long lasting excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) which forms the basis of long term potentiation (LTP). LTP is one form of synaptic plasticity wherein the strength of the synapses is enhanced by either change in the number, increase in the efficacy by phosphorylation or change in the type of receptors. Phosphorylation of AMPA receptors changes the localization of the receptors, increases the single channel conductance, and increases the probability of open channel. GluR1 has four phosphorylation sites; serine 818 (S818) is phosphorylated by PKC and is necessary for LTP, serine 831 (S831) is phosphorylated by CaMKII  that increases the delivery of receptors to the synapse and also increased their single channel conductance, threonine (T840) is implicated in LTP. Serine 845 (S845) is phosphorylated by PKA which regulates open channel probability.  Long term depression is another form of plasticity wherein the number of AMPA receptors is diminished by either phosphorylation of GluR2 at Ser880 or dephosphorylation of GluR1 by protein phosphatase1, protein phosphatase 2A and protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4460	OAS antiviral response		The human oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) family consists of four proteins whose production is stimulated by interferon, OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, and OASL. The first three members have the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity for which the family is named (Sadler AJ & Williams BR 2008), whereas OASL is devoid of this activity despite sharing significant sequence similarity with the other OAS proteins (Zhu J et al. 2015). OAS1, 2, and 3 are activated by double-stranded RNA to synthesize 5'-triphosphorylated 2'-5'-oligoadenylates (2-5A) from ATP (Kerr IM & Brown RE 1978). The 2-5A serve as chemically unique second messengers that induce regulated RNA decay by activating ribonuclease L (RNase L), thus mediating antiviral innate immunity (Zhou A et al. 1993; Lin RJ et al. 2009; Huang H et al. 2014; Han Y et al. 2014). RNase L has also been implicated in antibacterial innate immunity (Li XL et al. 2008). RNase L cleaves single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) in U-rich sequences, typically after UU or UA dinucleotides leaving a 5'-OH and 2',3'-cyclic phosphate (Floyd-Smith G et al. 1981; Wreschner DH et al.1981; Cooper DA et al. 2014).<p>Some OAS proteins have additional or alternative antiviral functions that are independent of RNase L activity (Perelygin AA et al., 2002; Kristiansen H et al. 2011). The precise mechanisms of RNase L-independent OAS antiviral activities remain to be fully elucidated.

It is adapted from figure 2 in [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29348254 Koupenova et al], in collaboration with Dr. Milka Koupenova. Platelets interact with endothelial and immune cells in the circulation, and control the response to microbes, inflammatory stimuli, and vessel damage. Through their TLRs or inflammatory signals, platelets can change their surface expression and release their granule content and in that way interact with different immune cells.Platelets form heterotypic aggregates with other immune cells and initiate innate immune responses in the presence of TLR agonists and viruses (encephalomyocarditis virus, coxsackievirus B, dengue, flu and HIV). Platelets can also interact with dendritic cells through P-selectin, and activate them to become antigen-presenting through their CD154. Platelets engage the adaptive immune response by releasing their granule content which leads to IgG production and control of T-cell function. Similarly, platelets are able to activate the endothelium, make it more permeable, and mediate leukocyte trafficking to the inflamed endothelium. Description is adapted from Koupenova et al.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4483	Relationship between inflammation, COX-2 and EGFR		Arachidonic acid metabolic pathway can be activated by inflammation (stimulus). Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by a phospholipase A2 (PLA-2) enzyme and converted to bioactive PGE-2 by COX-2. PGE2 induced transactivation of the EGFR by triggering Src and PGE2, an important regulator of CYP19A1 gene expression, stimulates CYP19A1 activity to increase localized estrogen 17-beta-estradiol (E2). The E2 binds to the classical ER to promote its dimerization and translocation to the nucleus where it modulates the expression of estrogen target genes (COX-2). The interaction of E2 with ER-alpha also activates signaling cascades that promote cell proliferation, such as the activation of c-Src tyrosine kinase (Src). Src activation stimulates a matrix metalloproteinase cascade that culminates in liberating the EGF. The free EGF ligand binds to EGFR family receptors that activates ERK signaling cascade. Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA) is a substrate for ERK and phosphorylation of cPLA (cPLAp), promoting its association with intracellular membranes such as those of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria releasing lysophospholipids and arachidonic acid from these membranes. COX-2 catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid into PGE-2. These key molecules and pathways that connect chronic inflammation with inflammation-associated oncogenic transformation could be targeted by drugs or natural products for novel preventive and therapeutic strategies for malignant mesothelioma.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4484	Control of immune tolerance by vasoactive intestinal peptide		Control of immune tolerance by VIP controls immune homeostasis. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is released from nerve terminals (nervous source) and blood (endocrine source), or produced by T helper 2 (TH2) cells or macrophages (immune source) in response to antigenic and inflammatory stimulation. VIP induces immune tolerance and inhibits the autoimmune response through different non-excluding mechanisms. First, it induces the generation and differentiation of TH2-cell functions and decrease TH1-cell functions through direct actions on differentiating T cells, or indirectly by regulating antigen presenting cell (APC) functions. As a consequence, the inflammatory and autoimmune responses are impaired, and the anti-helminthic and atopic responses are increased, because the infiltration and activation of neutrophils and macrophages by interferon-γ (IFNγ) and the production of complement-activating IgG2 antibodies are avoided. Second, VIP impairs the co-stimulatory activity of APCs on effector T cells, inhibiting subsequent clonal expansion. This avoids the inflammatory response and its cytotoxic effect against the target tissue. Third, VIP induces the generation of regulatory T cells that suppress the activation of autoreactive T cells by producing interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ). This effect contributes to the maintenance of an anti-inflammatory state and restores immune tolerance.		9606

Additionally, bacterial infection stimulates an immune response. Bacterial infection can activate macrophages and induce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-6 and IL-1. Both tissue damage and bacterial infection can induce complement activation, either via the alternative or classical pathway.

Through expression of cytokines such as TNF, TGF-beta and interferons, IL-1 holds a range of inflammatory activities that include induction of fever, expression of vascular adhesion molecules and roles in arthritis and septic shock. IL-1 binds to the respective IL-1 receptor however, it requires the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAP) to transduce a signal. Two kinases (IRAK-1 and IRAK-2) get activated through IL-1 binding to its receptor. Via these kinases a cascade gets activated which includes TRAF6, NF-kB activation and c-JUN activation. The IL-1 signaling cascade represents a highly conserved response to pathogens.		9606

Two plasmalipoproteins, LDL and HDL, and one plasma lipid, triglyceride (TG), play an important role in this pathway. Hydrophobic lipids and fat-soluble vitamins are normally transported to the site of their uptake by transporters called lipoproteins, and any deregulation of the plasma concentrations of these proteins can cause dyslipidemias. Disorders resulting from an enzyme deficiency are highlighted in pink. More details on the composition of the various lipoproteins in this pathway are visualised in [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP3601].This pathway was inspired by Chapter 43 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4523	Classical pathway of steroidogenesis with glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid metabolism		The biosynthesis of steroid hormones is a difficult process in which Cholesterol is transformed into mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids and sex hormones via a series of hydroxylation, oxidation and reduction steps. To better understand the molecular level of sexual organ maturation in humans, the classical pathway and the alternative pathway of this process are produced. The pathways produce the main steroid hormones in humans, namely Progestogen, Corticosteroids, Androgens and Estrogens. The classical pathway is meant to produce an important steroid called Androgen, which is a synthetic steroid hormone that regulates sexual development and the maintenance of the male sex organs via binding to androgen receptors. Next to the classical pathway of androgen synthesis, alternative pathways are known, such as [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4524].For more information and details about Androgens and the diseases linked with this molecular pathway, please visit Chapter 37 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)) .We have recently expanded this pathway with information from the Glucocorticoid and Mineralocorticoid Metabolism (previously captured in WP273; overlapping content is indicated with double borders for individual datanodes; information previously missing is added with dashed borders).Mineralocorticoid (M) and glucocorticoid (G) receptors regulate transcription; either through 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase influencing aldosterone specificity on epithelial M-receptors or by modulcation of AP-1- and NF-kappa-B-induced transcription through G-receptors. Specifically for the first case, aldosterone resistance in an autosomal form (aka pseudohypoaldosteronism) is linked to loss-of-function in epithelical Na-channel subunits [http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.med.48.1.231].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4524	Alternative pathway of fetal androgen synthesis		The development of sexual organs in humans is still not completely understood at the molecular level, controlled through the chromosomal difference between men and women. Steroids related to sexual development can have a temporary or permanent effects. Androgens are the leading compounds differentiating between (among other sexual organs) the internal and external genitalia of men.Next to the classical pathway of androgen synthesis (see [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4523]), alternative pathways are known, which make use of either selective expression patterns of isoenzymes or alternate enzymes. As an alternative, a socalled 'backdoor pathway', which can create dihydrotestosterone (DHT), skipping testosterone. Several enzymes between the classical and backdoor pathway are shared, however the later one utilises one unique enzyme, 3-alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 (gene: AKR1C2). Even though the relevance of this backdoor pathway for humans is not completely clear yet, mutations in the human AKR1C2 gene can lead to disordered sexual differentiation. This finding would indicate that both the classical and the alternative pathway are needed for normal development of male genitalia in humans.For more information on androgens, see Hiort (2013 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23800242]), and for more information on the disease linked to this pathway, please visit Chapter 37 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP453	Inflammatory response pathway		Inflammation is a protective response of cells to pathogens, infection or tissue damage. It involves the coordinated communication of different immune cells and blood vessels through an intricate cascade of molecular signals. Inflammation can cause fever, cardiovascular pathology, allergy anaphylaxis, fibrosis, autoimmunity, etc.The inflammatory response has four phases: inflammatory inducers (infection or tissue damage), inflammatory sensors (mast cells and macrophages), inflammatory mediators (cytokines, chemokines, etc.) and the tissues that are affected. Each phase has many options that are triggered based on the type pathogen introduced.In addition, chronic inflammatory conditions, where an inducer is not well defined, are becoming more common. These conditions are of particular interest because they coincide with other diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4535	Envelope proteins and their potential roles in EDMD physiopathology		Schematic model of the nuclear envelope proteins and their potential roles in Emery-Dreyfuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) physiopathology.Nuclear lamins form a meshwork. It interacts with proteins of the nuclear envelope, i.e., EMD, LBR, TMPO, SUN, and MAN1, and with several transcription factors. Through nesprin proteins, lamins interact with actin microfilaments, microtubules, and cytoplasmic intermediate filaments, connecting the nuclear lamina to the extracellular matrix.MKL1 translocates into the nucleus and together with SRF induces gene expression. In addition, EMD facilitates polymerization of nuclear actin, reducing the nuclear export of MKL1 to the cytoplasm. In EDMD cells, emerin mislocalizes and is unable to modulate nuclear actin polymerization. G-actin binds to MKL1 and it is exported from the nucleus, impairing gene expression. YAP and TAZ are key transcription factors for cell proliferation. YAP/TAZ activation causes their nuclear accumulation, promoting cell proliferation, and inhibiting differentiation. Nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ is increased in patient myoblasts with LMNA mutations.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4538	Regulatory circuits of the STAT3 signaling pathway		STAT3 activation works through phosphorylation on at tyrosine 705 by a variety of adaptor kinases (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2, SRC), resulting in dimers of STAT3 that translocates into the nucleus. Those adaptor kinases can be activated by a variety of receptors in response to cytokines or growth factors. Besides, an additional phosphate group can be added at serine 727 on each STAT3 (by MAPKs, mTOR, PKC), which enhances the transcriptional activity of STAT3 or directs STAT3 towards the mitochondria. Inside the nucleus, the STAT3 dimers are regulated by a variety of modifying factors, such as acetylation at lysine 685 by histone acetyltransferases, methylation at lysine 140 by histone methyltransferases to favor or impair STAT3 transcriptional activity, respectively. Other regulators of STAT3 include phosphatases (such as PTPRD, SOCS3, TRIM28, PIAS3) and miRNAs.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4539	Synaptic signaling pathways associated with autism spectrum disorder		Synaptic signaling pathways associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).Changes in mTOR activation is believed to be a risk factor for ASD. mTOR is regulated by the TCS1/2 complex, and several signaling pathways upstream of TSC1/2 positively or negatively regulate this complex, including PI3K–AKT, Ras–ERK, LKB1–AMPK and Wnt–GSK3β pathways.The mTOR pathway is also regulated by the brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which plays a key role in the development and the plasticity of the central nervous system and is considered a risk factor for ASD. Increased levels of BDNF concentration have been observed in the serum and brain of patients with ASD. mTOR is a key modulator of protein synthesis and thus blocks the activation of cell autophagy and promotes cell proliferation, growth, and differentiation.Proteasome activity is also affected by neuronal activity, via increased expression of UBE3A through transcription factor MEF2, which leads to the internalization of AMPA-R. Variations in the Calcium-channel CACNA1C are also associated with ASD and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_syndrome Timothy Syndrome].

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4545	Oxysterols derived from cholesterol		The Oxysterol group of compounds are oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol or its sterol precursors, e.g. 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) or desmosterol. There are three mechanisms leading to the formation of oxysterols: 1) Enzymatically (first steps of sterol metabolism, being intermediates for the formation of steroid hormones, bile acids and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3), 2) Non-enzymatically by encountering reactive oxygen species (ROS), providing a second pool of metabolites (this pool also includes oxidized cholesterol molecules taken in from diet), see https://www.wikipathways.org/instance/WP5064, and 3) Generation by the gut microflora and uptake through the enterohepatic circulation.Previously oxysterols where though to be inactive metabolic intermediates, however recent findings have established that these metabolites are involved in cholesterol homoeostasis, can be ligands to nuclear and G protein-coupled receptors and biomarkers of diseases (for example Niemann-Pick disease).This pathway drawing was inspired by Figure 3 of the review article by Griffiths et al. 2016, and has been extended with immune system, receptor agonists, steroidal alkaloid and biomarker information from the same paper.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4549	Fragile X syndrome		Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a monogenetic disorder caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene and the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Patients with FXS show a range of typical physical features such as macro-orchidism in males, a long and narrow face, large and protruding ears, and hyperextensible joints. Common comorbidities of FXS are neuropsychiatric disorders such as hyperactivity, depression and anxiety. The mutation of FMR1 in FXS disrupts production of the FMR1 gene product, the fragile mental retardation protein (FMRP). The main function of FMRP is to locally act as a translational repressor for target mRNAs and thereby regulate de novo protein synthesis and ultimately synaptic plasticity. FMRP, together with the mTOR pathway and the ERK pathway regulates expression of target mRNAsn mediated by stimulation of Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) and thereby regulate  α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) internalisation and thus long term depression (LTD).  LTD is a form of synaptic plasticity which is involved in learning and memory. Lack of FMRP leads to exaggerated mGluR dependant LTD, which accounts for most of FXS pathogenesis.		9606

FBXL10 silences the expression of DUSP6 through recruitment of polycomb repressuive complexes, which leads to the deposition of repressive histone modifications in the DUPS6 promoter. DUSP6 is a ERK1/2 (MAPK1/MAPK3) phosphatase and with lower levels of DUSP6, ERK1/2 remain phosphorylated and thus activates downstream ERK/MAPK signaling and ultimately cell proliferation.Based on figure 7 in [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5833345/ Zhao et al]		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4558	Overview of interferons-mediated signaling pathway		Interferons (IFNs) can be devided in three classes, Type I, II and III. Type I IFNs are created when the cell surface or specific receptors recognize microbial products; these are structural homologues of one another which bind the same receptor. Binding to this receptor leads to an activation of kinases which regulate the phosphorylation and therefore activation of some STAT proteins (see PW for details). There is only 1 Type II interferon, INF-gamma, consisting of two subunits (R1 and R2), which associate with Jak 1 and 2, respectively. Activation of Jak1 and Jak2 leads to phosphorylation of STAT1, which ultimately binds to IFN-gamma-activated sequence (GAS) elements, regulating the transcription of genes.  Type III interferons are considered a protein family of 4, which bind to a different receptor compared to Type I interferons, however they trigger the same STAT1+2 phosphorylation reactions as TypeI IFNs.		9606

Because there is no alternative way to convert toxic nitrogenous compounds, defects in the enzymes or transporters can lead to several diseases (diseases highlighted in pink). The diseases are characterised by hyperammonemia, respiratory alkalosis and encephalopathy and the severity of the disease depends on the severity of the defect and the place of the defect in the cycle.

Tumors can use these checkpoints to protect themselves from immune system attacks. CTLA-4 is expressed on T cells and is a negative regulator of T cell activation. CTLA4 counteracts the activity of the T cell co-stimulatory receptor, CD28, which amplifies TCR signaling once antigen is bound. CTLA-4 and CD28 share the same ligands, CD80 and CD86, although CTLA-4 has a higher affinity. This is represented in the pathway with a blue inhibitory interaction.  One strategy for cancer immunotherapy is to block CTLA-4, thereby removing the negative regulation on T-cell activation.

The virus also causes inhibition of IL-12 expression in dendritic cells, via H proteins on viral particles as well as N proteins from infected cells.This pathway is based on [https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?hsa05162 KEGG].		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4655	Cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway		As part of the innate immune system, specific cytosolic pattern recognition receptors recognize DNA from invading viruses and bacteria. These receptors have specificity for certain pathogens. The three receptors that recognize double-stranded cytosolic DNA are CGAS (GMP-AMP Synthase), ZBP1 (DAI) and AIM. CGAS signals via STING (TREM173) and eventually results in expression of type I interferons. ZBP1 activates NFkb and IRF transcription factors which results in expression of interferons and cytokines/chemokines. Activation of AIM leads to the formation of the inflammasome complex, which activates caspase-1 and triggers a form of apoptosis known as pyroptosis. In addition to sensors that directly detect DNA, another mechanism exists where the foreign DNA is first translated into RNA by host polymerase. The RNA is then recognized by the RNA sensor RIG-I, which leads to NFkb and IRF activation.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4656	Joubert syndrome		Joubert syndrome (JS) is a rare hereditary disorder that is classified as a ciliopathy, and is caused by mutations occurring in genes essential for the development and proper functioning of primary cellular cilia. These hair-like structures located on the cell membrane are responsible for detecting and relaying external signals to the interior of the cell. The defining JS feature is the molar tooth sign (MTS), which is the particular manner in which a characteristic malformation of midbrain appears in radiological imaging, and which causes delays in both intellectual and motor development. A visual representation of the pathways underlying JS pathogenesis was synthesized, which might provide a more complete understanding of the disease, possibly aiding in better diagnosis and more successful treatment.Data collection on the genes, pathways and interactions involved was done through a literature search in combination supported by online databases such as OMIM, STRING and GeneMANIA. The pathway was created using PathVisio version 3.3.0. Nodes were annotated using the appropriate Ensembl, ChEBI, or Uniprot-TrEMBL identifiers and standardized MIM notation was used to visualize the interactions between them.A final pathway containing 88 unique nodes and 71 interactions was created. The pathway highlights three functional or structural areas of the primary cilium that appear to play important roles in JS pathogenesis, namely the basal body or centriole, the transition zone and ciliary trafficking. Furthermore, two specific complexes seem to be of particular interest; the B9 ciliary complex and the centriolar satellite contain eight and three JS-associated protein respectively. Lastly, the ARL13B-PDE6D-INPP5E signaling network ensures the proper functioning of INPP5E, and enzyme that converts lipid ciliary membrane components. All three proteins have been found to be mutated in JS patients.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4659	Gastrin signaling pathway		Gastrin is a peptide hormone which is involved in the process of gastric acid secretion. Gastrin release is induced by the gastrin-releasing peptide, a neurotransmitter acting on its basolateral receptor in G-cells. Gastrin is then translocated to the oxyntic mucosa in an endocrine manner where it binds to its receptor CCKBR in parietal and enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. This interaction stimulates secretion of gastric acid by parietal cells and release of histamine by ECL cells. Histamine reaches parietal cells through paracrine diffusion where it binds H2 receptors and induces gastric acid secretion. Gastrin has been reported to stimulate proliferation of gastric mucosal cells,maturation of parietal cells and enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, and promote islet differentiation in the pancreas. Gastrin is also known to stimulate the proliferation, invasion, and migration of cancer cells. Produced as preprogastrin of 101 amino acids by the human G-cells of the antrum of stomach, it is sequentially cleaved to first yield progastrin and then 35-amino acid gastrin-34-Gly or an 18-amino acid gastrin-17-Gly that are often amidated.CCKAR and CCKBR cholecystokinin receptors belonging to the family of G-protein coupled receptors, are the best characterized receptors of Gastrin. CCKBR has high affinity for gastrin and their carboxyl amidated analogues, while the CCKAR has been reported to have negligible affinity. Gq-alpha had been the major identified G-alpha subunit involved in gastrin signaling. Gastrin induces the activation of Gq-alpha and regulates the levels of IP3 and DAG through PLC-gamma1 mediated hydrolysis of PIP2. SRC has also been shown to be involved in this regulation. SRC kinase is also involved in the activation of classical RAS/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways through IRS1-mediated recruitment of GRB2/SHC1/SOS complex and regulatory subunits of PI3Ks, respectively. PI3K pathway activation by SRC also involves the formation of SRC-FAK complexes. Gastrin induced MEK/ERK pathway is also reported to be mediated through PKCs. Gastrins have also been reported to regulate the activation of Rho, Rac and Cdc42 pathways. Recently, Liu and Jose 2013 have reported the regulation of MTOR and sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3 activities through a PI3K/PKC-dependent but AKT-independent pathway. Both p38MAPK and JNKs are also reported to be involved in gastrin signaling. PKAs as well as PKCs are involved in the regulation of p38MAPK activation whereas JNK activation has been shown to be mediated by MAP3K11 (MLK3). Gastrin induces the activation of eNOS and thereby nitric oxide production in ERK1/2, AKT, and p38MAPK dependent manner. Another major pathway involved in gastrin induced cell proliferation and migration is the beta-catenin/TCF-4 pathway. JAK-STAT pathway has also been shown to be involved in gastrin signaling. Interestingly, JAK2 activation has been identified to be also involved in activation of PI3K pathway.Apart from CCKAR and CCKBR, recently gastrin has also been shown to bind to Annexin A2 to mediate their effects. Thus far, gastrin induced activation of NFKBs, ERKs and p38MAPK have been reported to be mediated by both CCK receptor(s) as well as Annexin A2 in multiple cells/cell types.Visit: http://www.netpath.org/netslim/Gastrin_pathway.html		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP466	DNA replication		Studies in the past decade have suggested that the basic mechanism of DNA replication initiation is conserved in all kingdoms of life. Initiation in unicellular eukaryotes, in particular Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast), is well understood, and has served as a model for studies of DNA replication initiation in multicellular eukaryotes, including humans. In general terms, the first step of initiation is the binding of the replication initiator to the origin of replication. The replicative helicase is then assembled onto the origin, usually by a helicase assembly factor. Either shortly before or shortly after helicase assembly, some local unwinding of the origin of replication occurs in a region rich in adenine and thymine bases (often termed a DNA unwinding element, DUE). The unwound region provides the substrate for primer synthesis and initiation of DNA replication. The best-defined eukaryotic origins are those of S. cerevisiae, which have well-conserved sequence elements for initiator binding, DNA unwinding and binding of accessory proteins. In multicellular eukaryotes, unlike S. cerevisiae, these loci appear not to be defined by the presence of a DNA sequence motif. Indeed, choice of replication origins in a multicellular eukaryote may vary with developmental stage and tissue type. In cell-free models of metazoan DNA replication, such as the one provided by Xenopus egg extracts, there are only limited DNA sequence specificity requirements for replication initiation.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4666	Hepatitis B infection		The Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a virus in the Hepadnaviridae family which infects hepatocytes in the liver. It causes both acute and chronic infections, and prolonged chronic infection can lead to complications such as cirrhosis and an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The left side of the pathway describes the pathogenesis of HBV. The virus binds NTCP (SLC10A1) and is subsequently endocytosed. It is transported to the nucleus where viral polymerase creates covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). Using the host RNA polymerase, this is transcribed into viral mRNAs. Viral DNA polymerase then synthesizes viral DNA via its reverse transcriptase activity. Assembled viral particles exit the cell via the ESCRT pathway.The HBV regulatory protein HBx interferes with many cellular processes including transcription, signal transduction, cell cycle progress, protein degradation, apoptosis and chromosomal stability.

Most genomic alterations in HNSCC converge in a handful of molecular pathways resulting in cell cycle deregulation, genomic instability, cell differentiation defects, and persistent mitogenic signaling, the latter involving aberrant PI3K/mTOR pathway activation thereby rendering HNSCC responsive to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.Pathway is based on [https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4348071 Fig 1 from Iglesias-Bartolome et al], [https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14129 Fig 5 from Li et al] and [https://clinicalgate.com/the-molecular-pathogenesis-of-head-and-neck-cancer/ Fig 33-3 from Clinicalgate].

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4685	Melanoma		Melanoma, or malignant melanoma, is a highly aggressive cancer that develops in melanocytes. Many genes have been found to be mutated or amplified in melanoma, with the most commonly mutated genes being BRAF, CDKN2A, NRAS and TP53. MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling are central to melanoma. This pathway is a summary of information from figures 1 and 2 from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6520749/ Kunz and Vera] and supplemented with information from [https://www.kegg.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+hsa05218 KEGG]. CDKN2A is frequently mutated in melanoma and germline mutations are associated with an increased susceptibility of developing skin cancer. The CDKN2A encodes two proteins, p16 (INK4A) and p14ARF, with different functions. p16 binds to CDK4, which prevents phosphorylation of Rb, thereby controlling the G1 to S transition. Without functioning p16, G1 to S transition can proceed. p14ARF is central to cell cycle regulation, inhibiting MDM2, which normally degrades p53, so loss of p14ARF has a similar effect to loss of p53.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4698	Vitamin D-sensitive calcium signaling in depression		Depression has been linked to (lack of) sunlight exposure and raised intracellular calcium levels. In this pathway, the role of the vitamin D pathway in calcium signaling in depression is shown. Active 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 is formed from 7-dehydrocholesterol by multiple conversion steps. It associates with RXR and VDR in the nucleus, which stimulates transcription of VDR target genes, resulting in lower intracellular calcium levels. Less sunlight exposure results in lower 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels and therefore higher calcium levels.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP47	Hedgehog signaling pathway		The Hedgehog family of proteins are signaling proteins that are crucial for a number of physiological processes including morphogenesis during development. In adult organisms, it is also involved in the regulation of theca cell development in growing follicles and in regulating the development and function of the somatic cells of the testis. Vertebrates are known to have 3 Hedgehog genes, which show different spatio-temporal expression patterns and perform specialized functions. These are - Desert hedgehog (Dhh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh), and Sonic hedgehog (Shh). The Patched (PTCH) proteins (Patched 1 and Patched 2 - PTCH1 and PTCH2) serve as receptors for the Hedgehog proteins. In the 'off' state, PTCH receptors inhibit the Smo protein by mechanism(s) which are still not understood completely. In this state, the Gli2/3 Zn-finger transcription factors are phosphorylated and processed in a proteasome-dependent manner to generate a transcriptionally repressor form. SUFU, a cytoplasmic protein, was also found to interact with all the three Gli proteins resulting in the repression of its transcriptional activity. In the 'Signaling cell', which is the cell which secretes the Hedgehog proteins, an active ligand is produced following processing of the precursor Hedgehog protein. This processing involves autocleavage by the catalytic domain and bi-lipidation (cholesterol moiety at C-terminus and palmitate at the N-terminus) of the Hedgehog protein. These active ligands travel to the 'responding cell' via interactions with glypicans and megalin. On the responding cell, the active ligand interacts with PATCHED 1 (PTCH1) and PATCHED 2 (PTCH2), which results in the activation and translocation of Smoothed (Smo) to the cilium(plasma membrane in Drosophila). Activation of Smo results in the inhibition of Gli proteolysis and the production of the transcriptional repressor form. This might also promote the formation of the transcription activator form of the protein. The G-protein coupled receptor kinase-2 enhances the association between β-arrestin 2 and Smo probably by phosphorylating Smo. The two proteins also mediates increased internalization of Smo in a clathrin- dependent process and increased Hedgehog signaling. Kif7, a Drosophila Costal2 (Cos2) homolog, is capable of interacting with the Gli proteins and is known to exert positive and negative effects on Hedgehog signaling. The Fused (Fu) homolog, which can form a complex with Kif7, Gli and and SuFu (similar to Drosophila Gli, Cos2, Su and SuFu) may also be involved in the regulation of this pathway.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/hedgehog_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite the following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP474	Endochondral ossification		Endochondral ossification is the process by which the embryonic cartilaginous model of most bones contributes to longitudinal growth and is gradually replaced by bone. During endochondral ossification, chondrocytes proliferate, undergo hypertrophy and die; the cartilage extracellular matrix they construct is then invaded by blood vessels, osteoclasts, bone marrow cells and osteoblasts, the last of which deposit bone on remnants of cartilage matrix. The sequential changes in chondrocyte behaviour are tightly regulated by both systemic factors and locally secreted factors, which act on receptors to effect intracellular signalling and activation of chondrocyte-selective transcription factors. Systemic factors that regulate the behaviour of chondrocytes in growth cartilage include growth hormone and thyroid hormone, and the local secreted factors include Indian hedgehog, parathyroid hormone-related peptide, fibroblast growth factors and components of the cartilage extracellular matrix. Transcription factors that play critical roles in regulation of chondrocyte gene expression under the control of these extracellular factors include Runx2, Sox9 and MEF2C. The invasion of cartilage matrix by the ossification front is dependent on its resorption by members of the matrix metalloproteinase family, as well as the presence of blood vessels and bone-resorbing osteoclast (Mackie et al.)Thyroid hormone and especially triiodothyronine induce morphological hypertrophy of chondrocytes, through binding to thyroid hormone receptors. Further, triiodothyronine increases the total collagen production in chondrocytes, as also terminal differentiation, but triiodothyronine also induces cell death through non-apoptotic modes of physiological death. Triiodothyronine acts by altering intracellular gene expression after receptor binding, and is crucial for growth, as receptor deficiencies lead to dwarfism and growth retardation. Thyroid hormone inhibits the PTHR1 gene, which encodes for a g-protein coupled receptor for parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-like hormones. PTH receptors activate adenylyl cyclase and a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. They control the levels of calcium in the blood and thus, ossification as they inhibit hypertrophy upon activation (Mackie, Randau, https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/jansen-type-metaphyseal-chondrodysplasia/ ).Oxygen acts upon RUNX2 and HDAC4 in the ossification process. HDAC4 is a class II histone deacetylase/acuc/apha family gene, and if tethered to a promoter, it represses transcription (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9759). Via this mechanism, HDAC4 represses RUNX2 in the ossification process. RUNX2 is a member of the RUNX family of transcription factors, encoding a nuclear protein with an RUND DNA-binding domain. It induces osteoblastic differentiation and skeletal morphogenesis, as it acts upon the DNA and regulatory factors (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/860). Thus, RUNX2 acts directly upon chondrocytical hypertrophy. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) act upon protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates proteins if activated. In this case it leads to the inhibition of Sox9 (https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3314).

It can induce two opposite intracellular signaling cascades depending on the presence or absence of the ligand and is thus capable of driving two opposing processes. UNC5B signaling has been implicated in several cancers, where it promotes cell death in the absence of its ligand netrin-1 and increases cell survival in its presence. In addition, inhibition of the ligand has been reported to decrease invasiveness and angiogenesis in tumors. UNC5B signaling pathway has also been reported to be involved in several processes such as neural development, developmental angiogenesis and inflammatory processes.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4752	Base excision repair		Base excision repair is a cellular mechanism that repairs damaged DNA throughout the cell cycle. It is primarily responsible for removing small, non-helix-distorting base lesions from the genome. Base excision repair is important for removing damaged bases that could otherwise cause mutations by mispairing, or could lead to breaks in DNA during replication. BER is initiated by DNA glycosylases, which recognize and remove specific damaged or inappropriate bases, forming AP sites. These are then cleaved by an AP endonuclease. The resulting single-strand break can then be processed by either short-patch (where a single nucleotide is replaced) or long-patch BER (where 2-10 new nucleotides are synthesized). The choice between short- and long-patch repair is currently under investigation. Various factors are thought to influence this decision, including the type of lesion, the cell cycle stage, and whether the cell is terminally differentiated or actively dividing. Some lesions, such as oxidized or reduced AP sites, are resistant to pol β lyase activity and therefore must be processed by long-patch BER.This pathway is based on information from [http://repairtoire.genesilico.pl/Pathway/4/ REPAIRtoire], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_excision_repair Wikipedia] and [https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?map03410 KEGG].

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4753	Nucleotide excision repair		Nucleotide excision repair is a DNA repair mechanism that repairs DNA damaged by UV radiation. This type of damage produces bulky distortions in the shape of DNA double helix due to the addition of DNA adducts, mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts.Recognition of distortions leads to the removal of a short single-stranded DNA segment that includes the lesion, creating a single-strand gap in the DNA, which is subsequently filled in by DNA polymerase, which uses the undamaged strand as a template. NER can be divided into two subpathways (Global genomic NER and Transcription coupled NER) that differ only in their recognition of helix-distorting DNA damage. Nucleotide excision repair has more complexity in eukaryotes. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a particularly important DNA repair mechanism as evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins including Xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome.This pathway was adapted from [https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+hsa03420 KEGG], [http://repairtoire.genesilico.pl/Pathway/2/ REPAIRtoire] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide_excision_repair Wikipedia].

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4754	IL-18 signaling pathway		Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a member of the IL-1 family of cytokines and was initially described as an IFN-Î³-inducing factor derived from anti-CD3-stimulated T-helper (Th)1 cells. IL-18 plays a significant role in the activation of hematopoietic cell types mediating both Th1 and Th2 responses and is the primary inducer of interferon-Î³ in these cells. The biological activity of IL-18 is mediated through its binding to the IL-18 receptor complex and activation of nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB), culminating in the production and release of several cytokines, chemokines, and cellular adhesion molecules. In certain cell types, IL-18 also activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/ AKT serine/threonine kinase (PI3K/AKT) signaling modules leading to the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines. IL-18-mediated signaling acts as one of the vital components of the immunomodulatory cytokine networks involved in host defense, inflammation, and tissue regeneration. Albeit its biomedical importance, a comprehensive resource of IL-18 mediated signaling pathway is currently lacking. In this study, we report on the development of an integrated pathway map of IL-18/IL-18R signaling. The pathway map was developed through literature mining from published literature based on manual curation guidelines adapted from NetPath and includes information on 16 protein-protein interaction events, 38 enzyme-catalysis events, 12 protein translocation events, 26 activations/inhibition events, transcriptional regulators, 230 gene regulation events and 84 induced protein expression events.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4760	PKC-gamma calcium signaling pathway in ataxia		PKC-gamma calcium-signaling pathway in Ataxia. Upon ligand binding, the mGluR1 receptor is followed by activation of Gq causing PLC-mediated hydrolysis of PIP2 into IP3 and DAG. Binding of IP3 to the IP3R1 induces Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytoplasm. This step is controlled by CAR8, which can inhibit binding of IP3 to the IP3R1. Simultaneous binding of Ca2+ to PKC-gamma C2 domain and of DAG to the C1 domain of PKC-gamma  induce translocation of PKC-gamma to the plasma membrane. There, the pseudosubstrate is released from the kinase domain, allowing phosphorylation of downstream target proteins, including GRIA1. PKC exerts an inhibitory effect on TRPC3 channel either directly through phosphorylation or indirectly. A rise of the intracellular calcium concentration can also be mediated by the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel Cav2.1 or TRPC3. Conversely, PMCA2 can efficiently remove Ca2+ from the cytoplasm.Mutations:* mGluR1 - Ataxia* CA8: Ataxia* IP3R1: spinocerebellar ataxia type 1,2,3 / 15,16 / 29* PRKCG: spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 * CACNA1A: spinocerebellar ataxia type 6* TRPC3: spinocerebellar ataxia type 41* ATP2B2: AtaxiaThis pathway is based on fig 1B from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5883377/ Shimobayashi and Kapfhammer].		9606

The balance of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation is controlled by crosstalk of several signaling pathways. Expression of FGFR3 is enhanced by thyroid hormone (T3/3,3',5'-Triiodothyronine) and suppressed by PTHLH (member of the parathyroid hormone family). FGFR3 signaling results in increased expression of Snail1 (encoded by SNAI1), which is required for activation of STAT1 and MAPK signaling (ERK1/2 and p38 branches). Signaling from PTHLH, IHH and BMPs antagonizes the suppression of chondrocyte proliferation by FGFR3. Both FGFR3 and PTHLH function to suppress chondrocyte differentiation and antagonize the action of Wnt signaling, which promotes differentiation. FGFR3 negatively regulates the autophagy protein, ATG5. Activation of downstream signals: PP2a (encoded by PPP2CA) regulates p107 (encoded by RBL1) activation, and STAT1 regulates p21Waf1/Cip1 (encoded by CKDN1A) activation. Both function to suppress chondrocyte proliferation. Activation of the MAPKs, ERK1, and ERK2, regulate Sox9 expression, which functions to suppress chondrocyte terminal differentiation and endochondral ossification.Linked with a dotted arrow to the GeneProduct nodes are diseases caused by mutation in the respective gene.Protein phosphorylation sites were added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus (R), www.phosphosite.org.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4784	Proteoglycan biosynthesis		PG synthesis is a complex mechanism that can be divided in four main steps. Core protein synthesis occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Once PG core protein has been synthesized, it moves from the RER to the Golgi apparatus where the first sugar of glycosaminoalycan (GAG) chain is added on Ser residues. GAG synthesis continues by glycosyltransferases that transfer sugar moieties from UDP-sugars to GAG chains. UDP-sugars are synthesized in the cytoplasm and are translocated in the Golgi apparatus by an antiporter with UMP. Then UDP, the by-product of glycosyltransferase reactions, is hydrolyzed to UMP and phosphate by calcium activated nucleotidase 1 (CANT1). Chondroitin, dermatan and heparan sulfate synthesis starts on a Ser residue of the PG core protein with the formation of a tetrasaccharide linkage region composed of a xylose (Xyl), two galactoses (Gal) and a glucuronic acid (GlcUA). After tetrasaccharide synthesis, GAG chain elongation continues through the binding of specific saccharides defining chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. Specific enzymes are involved in this process and mutations in their gene cause different types of skeletal dysplasia (indicated in red boxes). The third step is GAG sulfation.  Sulfate enters in cells through the SLC26A2 transporter and it is activated to 30-phosphoadenosine 50-phosphosulfate (PAPS) by PAPS synthase (PAPSS) in the cytosol. Through a PAPS transporter (PAPST), PAPS moves to Golgi apparatus where it is used as sulfate donor by sulfotransferases to sulfate GAGs. This reaction also produces phosphoadenosine phosphate (PAP), that is hydrolyzed into AMP and phosphate by a Golgi resident phosphoadenosine phosphate phosphatase (gPAPP). Once synthesized, PGs are secreted in extracellular space.Sulfation of GAGs is an important step in PG synthesis determining PG properties. Inorganic sulfate enters in cells through a sulfate/chloride antiporter named SLC26A2, but a small amount of sulfate could be derived from sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism. To be used by Golgi sulfotransferases, sulfate is activated to 30-phosphoadenosine 50-phosphosulfate (PAPS), the universal sulfate donor, by PAPS synthase (PAPSS2). The by-product of sulfotransferase reactions, phosphoadenosine phosphate (PAP), is hydrolyzed by a Golgi resident phosphoadenosine phosphate phosphatase (gPAPP) in order to prevent feedback inhibition of these reactions.Linked with a dotted arrow to the GeneProduct nodes are skeletal dysplasias caused by mutation in the respective gene.For further details, see [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31286677].		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4786	Type I collagen synthesis in the context of osteogenesis imperfecta		Type I collagen — the major protein component of the extracellular matrix in bone, skin and tendon — is mainly secreted by osteoblasts, dermal fibroblasts and tenocytes. Despite the relatively simple structure of the collagen triple helix, the biosynthesis of type I procollagen is extremely complex, involving multiple steps and requiring an ensemble of proteins for post-translational modifications, folding, transport, secretion and quality control. The COL1A1 and COL1A2 transcripts are translated in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), and the α(I)‑chains undergo a series of post-translational modifications. Helical prolines in position Y of the Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeat are hydroxylated in position C4 by prolyl 4‑hydroxylase 1 (P4H1), whereas specific prolines in the X positions are 3‑hydroxylated by P3H1 and P3H2. Some lysine residues are hydroxylated by lysyl hydroxylases (LH1 and LH2, encoded by PLOD1 and PLOD2 respectively), and glycosylation of hydroxylysines into galactosyl-hydroxylysine and glucosyl-galactosyl-hydroxylysine is catalysed by procollagen galactosyltransferase 1 and procollagen glucosyltransferase 1. After synthesis of the carboxy-terminal propeptide, it forms intra-chain disulfide bonds and remains attached to the rER membrane. Selection and association of the correct chains into a triple helix occur by diffusion of the C-propeptides attached to the rER membrane. A nucleus for triple helix formation is formed that staggers the chains in the correct order and initiates triple helix formation. Protein disulfide isomerase catalyses inter-chain disulfide bond formation, which stabilize the folding nucleus. Hydroxylation of proline residues and some lysine residues continues and triple helix formation proceeds from the C-terminal end towards the amino-terminal end. During this phase, 65 kDa FK506‑binding protein (FKBP65; encoded by FKBP10) and a complex formed by P3H1 — CRTAP– PPIase B (peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans isomerase B) — seem to play a crucial part. The complex is involved in the Hydroxylation of proline 986 of the collagen α1(I)-chain and α1(II)-chain and proline 707 of the α2(I)-chain, which are thought to be important for supramolecular assembly of collagen fibrils and to serve as binding sites for chaperones or small leucine-rich proteoglycans. Beyond its prolyl 3‑hydroxylase activity, the complex functions as a PPIase and chaperone for collagen folding. Indeed, the fast propagation of the triple helix requires the isomerization of cis peptide bonds that convert proline residues into trans configuration, mainly by PPIase B24. When most of the helix is folded, the N-propeptides associate and form the small triple helix within this domain. The newly formed triple helix is stabilized by serpin H1 (also known as HSP47; encoded by SERPINH1) and FKBP65. Further modifications occur during transport from the rER to the Golgi apparatus in special coat protein complex vesicles that contain melanoma inhibitory activity protein 3 (also known as TANGO1, encoded by MIA) and through the Golgi stack by cisternal maturation. Serpin H1 also has binding sites along the helical portion of the molecule and assists shuttling of folded collagen into the cis-Golgi. These biosynthetic steps depend on a proper rER environment (for example, optimal calcium levels and redox potential), and the quality-control mechanisms can lead to the activation of the unfolded protein response using the ER-associated degradation pathway or the autophagy-mediated lysosomal degradation system to eliminate molecules that were not properly folded. Once secreted, the propeptides of procollagen are cleaved by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 2 (ADAMTS2) and bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1) into mature type I collagen. This initiates collagen fibre formation and these fibrils are stabilized by crosslink formation, in which certain lysine and hydroxylysine residues in the triple helix and the  telopeptides are oxidized by lysyl oxidases and converted into allysine and hydroxyallysine. These residues then initially form divalent crosslinks that convert into mature trivalent pyridinoline and pyrrole crosslinks to stabilize the fibril structure in tissues.Bone formation consists of the secretion of bone extracellular matrix components (mainly type I collagen) by osteoblasts. The unmineralized bone matrix (osteoid) subsequently becomes mineralized. In addition, osteoblasts and osteocytes release many cytokines, including receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL; also known as TNFSF11) and osteoprotegerin (OPG, encoded by TNFRSF11B), which regulate bone resorption by osteoclasts. RANKL acts on osteoclast precursor cells by binding to receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK; also known as TNFRSF11A) on their surface, thereby favouring their differentiation to osteoclasts. OPG, by interacting with RANKL, prevents the binding of RANKL to RANK. Some osteoblasts become embedded in the mineralized bone matrix and differentiate to osteocytes, which produce, among other factors, sclerostin, an inhibitor of the WNT pathway that is known to stimulate bone formation by stimulating osteoblast activity.Linked with a dotted arrow to the GeneProduct nodes are diseases caused by mutation in the respective gene.Adapted from [5]		9606

In intramembranous ossification (osteogenesis in the scull and clavicles), preosteoblasts stem directly from mesenchymal stem cells, while in endochondral (osteogenesis of the axial skeleton and the limbs) a common osteo-chondro progenitor gives rise to both cell types.Extracellular signals regulating osteoblast differentiation: Model is based on studies of the mouse limb skeleton. Osteoblasts differentiate from mesenchymal progenitors (MP) through distinct developmental stages marked by expression of key transcription factors including SOX9, RUNX2, and OSX. Mature osteoblasts (OB) can further differentiate to osteocytes (OCY) or bone lining cells (not depicted) or undergo apoptosis (not depicted).Indian hedgehog (IHH) signaling is required for osteoblast differentiation during endochondral bone development. IHH binding to the receptor Patched homolog 1 (PTCH1) activates signaling through Smoothened (SMO), thereby inhibiting the generation of the proteolytically cleaved GLI3 repressor (GLI3R) and promoting the generation of the full-length GLI2 activator (GLI2A). Whereas derepression of GLI3R is sufficient to generate RUNX2+ cells, both derepression of GLI3R and activation of GLI2A are necessary for progression to the RUNX2+OSX+ stage. NOTCH signaling inhibits osteoblast differentiation. Following binding to their ligands, Jagged (JAG) or Delta-like (DLL), Notch receptors are proteolytically cleaved by the g-secretase complex, leading to release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the plasma membrane. NICD interacts with RBPJk and together they activate downstream target genes, including HES (Hairy and Enhancer of Split) and HEY (HES-related with YRPW motif) family transcription factors, ultimately leading to inhibition of osteoblast differentiation, seemingly at a stage before OSX activation.WNT signaling promotes osteoblast differentiation. During b-catenin-dependent WNT signaling, b-catenin is stabilized following binding of WNT to its receptors Frizzled (FZD) and lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) or LRP6, leading to the transcription of b-catenin target genes and ultimately stimulating progression from the RUNX2+ stage to the RUNX2+OSX+ stage, and from RUNX2+OSX+ cells to mature osteoblasts. WNTcan also signal independently of LRP5/6 and b-catenin through protein kinase Cd (PKCd), promoting progression to the RUNX2+OSX+ stage through an unknown mechanism.Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling stimulates osteoblast differentiation and function. Binding of BMP2 or BMP4 to their receptors results in phosphorylation of SMAD1, SMAD5, or SMAD8. These can then form a complex with their partner, SMAD4, and enter the nucleus to regulate gene expression, ultimately promoting the transition to RUNX2+OSX+ cells and enhancing the function of mature osteoblasts; however, a direct role for SMAD signaling in osteoblast differentiation remains to be shown.Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling has diverse roles in osteoblast lineage cells. FGFs function by binding to cell surface Tyr kinase FGF receptors (FGFR1–FGFR4 in humans and mice), leading to the activation of multiple signaling modules. FGF signaling regulates preosteoblast proliferation and osteoblast differentiation, as well as the function of mature osteoblasts. However, the precise stages at which FGFs regulate proliferation and differentiation, and the intracellular signaling cascades responsible for each function, remain to be elucidated.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4788	Autosomal recessive osteopetrosis pathways		Taken from Osteopetrosis: genetics, treatment and new insights into osteoclast function by Cristina Sobacchi, Ansgar Schulz, Fraser P. Coxon, Anna Villa and Miep H. Helfrich [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23877423].The osteopetroses are genetic diseases characterized by increased bone mass and density due to a failure in bone resorption. Two major forms can be distinguished on the basis of their mode of inheritance: autosomal dominant osteopetrosis (ADO, formerly known as Albers-Schönberg disease), is usually considered an adult-onset, more benign form (and has been comprehensively reviewed elsewhere); whereas autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO), also termed malignant infantile osteopetrosis, presents soon after birth, is often severe and leads to death if left untreated.Mechanisms underlying osteoclast-‑rich ARO:Ruffled border formation and bone resorption by osteoclasts are dependent on secretory lysosome trafficking. Genes implicated in osteoclast-‑rich autosomal recessive osteopetrosis encode proteins that localize to secretory lysosomes in osteoclasts. TCIRG1 encodes the a3 subunit of the V0 complex, part of the V‑ATPase proton pump that acidifies endosomes and lysosomes; CLCN7 encodes ClC‑7, the Cl– antiporter responsible for increasing lumenal Cl– concentration; OSTM1 encodes the β‑subunit of CIC‑7; PLEKHM1 encodes a cytosolic protein that binds to the active (GTP-‑bound) form of Rab7, which is associated with late endosomes and lysosomes; and SNX10 encodes sorting nexin 10, which localizes to endosomes via a phosphoinositide-‑binding PX domain. This domain also interacts with the V1 complex D subunit of V‑ATPase, raising the possibility that SNX10 is involved in trafficking of V‑ATPase. ARO-‑causing mutations in all five genes disrupt trafficking of secretory lysosomes, thereby impairing ruffled-‑border formation and bone resorption. Osteoclast formation and adhesion to bone through the sealing zone are unaffected.Mechanisms underlying osteoclast-‑poor ARO:Osteoclastogenesis is dependent on the RANK signalling pathway. In normal osteoclasts, binding of RANKL recruits TRAF6, which releases NFκB from its phosphorylated inhibitor IκB. NFκB translocates to the nucleus and regulates transcription of key osteoclast genes. Osteopetrosis-‑causing mutations in TNFRSF11A (which encodes RANK) either reduce protein expression at the plasma membrane  or impair RANKL binding, which leads to the loss of NFκB signalling and prevents differentiation and fusion of osteoclast precursors. Similarly, osteoclast differentiation defects are seen if osteopetrosis-‑causing mutations in TNFSF11 (which encodes RANKL) are present. Mutations identified so far lead to reduced RANKL trimerization or impaired RANK binding. Osteoclast formation studies in vitro reveal these two distinct osteoclast-‑poor forms of ARO: those in which osteoclastogenesis cannot be induced by synthetic RANKL (TNFRSF11A-‑related ARO) and those in which osteoclastogenesis can be induced by synthetic RANKL, resulting in osteoclasts that function normally (TNFSF11-‑related ARO).

The most common form, X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH), is caused by inactivating mutations in the PHEX gene, which encodes the phosphate-regulating neutral endopeptidase PHEX.  Patients with XLH have elevated levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), which is thought to mediate many of the clinical manifestations of the disease. Elevated FGF23 levels have also been observed in other hypophosphatemic disorders, yet the role of FGF23 in the pathophysiology of these disorders is incompletely understood. This pathway illustrates hypophosphatemic and autocrine/paracrine molecular pathways that have been proposed to link FGF23 to the bone abnormalities observed in XLH and related disorders.

Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, EGFR, is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase that binds to the EGF-family of ligands. It activates several downstream signaling cascades, including MAPK, and leads to DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Mutations and over-expression in EGFR is implicated in many cancers. The section of the pathway outlined in pink corresponds to mechanisms of TKI resistance. This pathway was based on [https://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?hsa01521 KEGG]. Protein phosphorylation sites were added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus (R), www.phosphosite.org.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4816	TGF-beta receptor signaling in skeletal dysplasias		This diagram shows which skeletal dysplasias are caused by abnormalities in in TGF-beta signalling. The diagram is based on pathway: [[Pathway:WP560|TGF-beta Receptor Signaling (Homo sapiens)]].Dotted arrows indicates that a disease is caused by mutation in the respective gene.The exact role of ADAMTS10 and ADAMTSL2 is currently unknown, they are known to interact with FBN1.The Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway is involved in many cellular processes in both the adult organism and the developing embryo including cell growth, cell differentiation, apoptosis, cellular homeostasis and other cellular functions. In spite of the wide range of cellular processes that the TGFβ signaling pathway regulates, the process is relatively simple. TGFβ superfamily ligands bind to a type II receptor, which recruits and phosphorylates a type I receptor. The type I receptor then phosphorylates receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs) which can now bind the coSMAD SMAD4. R-SMAD/coSMAD complexes accumulate in the nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the regulation of target gene expression.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4829	mBDNF and proBDNF regulation of GABA neurotransmission		This pathway depicts the regulation of GABA receptor surface expression of BDNF signaling. BDNF can be secreted in both a mature form (mBDNF) and a precursor form (proBDNF), both of which modulate GABA synaptic transmission in neurons. mBDNF activates TrkB receptors leading to an inhibition of GABAAR endocytosis and a consequent increase in cell surface expression of these receptors through the PI 3-kinase and the PKC signaling pathway. In addition, BDNF/TrkB signaling regulates GABAAR and KCC2 at the transcriptional level through the Shc, PLCg and MAP/ERK pathways. proBDNF activates NGFR, which decreases GABAARs cell surface expression through the RhoA/ROCK/PTEN pathway, through dephosphorylation of GABAAR followed by endocytosis and degradation of internalized receptors. proBNDF/NGFR signaling also leads to the transcriptional repression of GABAAR synthesis through JAK2/STAT3/CREM. The proBDNF/NGFR signaling also decreases KCC2 expression.This pathway is based on figure 1 from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121065/ Porcher et al].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4830	GDNF/RET signaling axis		GDNF-RET signalling is at the core of the signalling network in kidney development.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4838	Regucalcin in proximal tubule epithelial kidney cells		This pathway includes the proximal tubule epithelial kidney cells (NRK52E cell) with a basolateral and apical side and other schematic illustrated organelles involved in the process of kidney function. The influence of regucalcin on the intra-and extracellular Ca2+ regulation is showed which are both involved in cell proliferation, ion transport and apoptosis and are important in normal kidney function. When the regulation of regucalcin and other factors are downregulated and suppressed, the kidney fails in functionality and so renal fibrosis will develop.  First of all, TGF-B (TGFB1) and TNF-a (TNFA) do have an impact on the activity of SMAD2/4 which has an impact on the development of a-SMA (ACTA2) that induced renal fibrosis. NF-kB (TNFSF11), stimulated by TNF-a, activates the transcription factor p65 (RELA) that induced the IL-8 expression which is involved in inflammatory pathways. On the other hand, regucalcin inhibits the a-SMA which means that the formation of renal fibrosis is inhibited. Further, TGF-B stimulates the caspase 8 (CASP8) that activates the cytochrome C which activate the apoptosis pathway. Also, here regucalcin function as an inhibitor for APAF1 that results in an inhibition of the apoptosis pathway and activate the BCL-2 (suppressor of apoptotic cell death). Besides the TGF-B and TNF-a pathway, there is an RTK pathway illustrated which activates the PI3K (PI3K3CA) and RAS (G3BP1) pathway for stimulation of the renal homeostasis, autophagy, protein and cell proliferation. According to Yamaguchi M. (2015), regucalcin activates the AKT1 to induce the renal homeostasis, autophagy and protein proliferation even further when PI3K is inhibited. The RTK pathway shows interaction with the cAMP pathway that stimulate the protein kinase A (PRKACA) and the PIP2 pathway that stimulate the protein kinase C (PRKCQ) and IP3. These all will stimulate Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  This Ca2+ can migrate and enters the mitochondria through the Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) which results in the activation of mitochondrial biological processes or release of different mitochondrial factors. Hence, calcium controls and modulate cell apoptosis and inflammation. MAP3K pathway might be involved in the stimulation of RAF1 to induce the cell proliferation and the increase in apoptosis by inhibition of BCL-2 through JNK (MAPK10) which is also activated by ROS. Ca2+ released by the ER can also bind to calmodulin to form the Ca2+/Calmodulin complex that stimulates IP3, JNK, NOS, RGPR—p117 (SEC16B) and NF1. The latter two proteins are involved in the enhancement of regucalcin gene expression. On the other hand, regucalcin can inhibit the activity of Ca2+/Calmodulin complex and the NOS. Normally, phosphodiesterase (PDE1B) binds cAMP that induced the degradation of cAMP which results in a decrease of protein kinase A that leads to a reduction of ER Ca2+ release. Regucalcin inhibits the phosphodiesterase in such a way that cAMP will not be degraded and the ER Ca2+ release can further occur. Remaining Ca2+ released from the ER can also transport to the microsomes, enters vis Ca2+ uniporter, to induce microsomal activities. This process of microsomal Ca2+ uptake can be diminished through the inhibition of IP3 kinase. Regucalcin is not only involved in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ release or uptake, but also extracellular Ca2+ by stimulating the Ca2+/ATPase (ATP2B3) which leads to Ca2+ export. Besides that, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (SLC8A1) is important to be present on the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule epithelial kidney cell to regulate the ion transport. On the apical membrane is the TRPV5 receptor present that regulate the import of Ca2+ from the lumen back into the kidney cell, but Ca2+ can also travel via paracellular transport. Further, in the nucleus the regucalcin has an influence on the inhibition of the serine/threonine phosphate (PSP), tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) and calcineurin (PPP3R1) gene expression. Normally, PSP stimulates the protein kinase A- and so the ER Ca2+ release-, PTP stimulates the cell growth and differentiation and calcineurin will migrate to the cytoplasm for binding to the Ca2+ and stimulates the formation of Ca2+/Calmodulin complex. In general, regucalcin regulates the factors and proteins involved in ion transport, cell proliferation and apoptosis. Research is done on rats.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4842	Mammalian disorder of sexual development		Multiple genes in the genital ridge are of importance for the formation of the bipotential ridge. Several of these genes are WT1, EMX2, PBX1, and CBX2. After 7 weeks there is a differentiation between XY and XX gonads.In the XX gonad, the absence of the gene SRY will result in the under expression of the SOX9 gene. This will have as a consequence that the SOX9 gene will not reach its threshold. Along with the expression of RSPO1 and WNT4, β-catenin is signalled and will lead to further inhibition of SOX9 and stimulation of FST and FOXL2. Both RSPO1 and WNT, as well as the combination of FST and FOXL2 are stimulated by NR5A1. This process will lead to the formation of the ovary due to the suppression of the formation of the testis, by inhibition of the genes. Due to the absence of androgens the female reproductive system can develop.In the XY gonad the gene SRY is expressed in the pre-Sertoli cells leading to an upregulation of the SOX9 gene. In this upregulation NR5A1 has a promoting function to increase the SOX9 levels until it reaches its threshold level. once this level is reached a regulatory loop of FGF9 and PGD2 is activated to keep constant levels of SOX9. Another promoting factor of SOX9 is PGDS, this factor also stimulates the expression of SOX9. After the threshold levels are reached AMH is stimulated by SOX9. This stimulation is being catalysed by NR5A1, GATA4, WT1 and SOX8. AMH can then further stimulate AMHR2 and promote the regression of the Müllerian Ducts. AMH is possibly also involved in the suppression of genes involved in the formation of female structures, such as FOXL2 by DMRT1. When the Sertoli Cell is fully formed, it can induce the development of foetal Leydig cells via the DHH-pathway which produced INSL3. INSL3 is promoted by testosterone. Testosterone in itself is stimulated by NR5A1 and also stimulates the formation of 5-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The stimulation of DHT is catalysed by SRD5A1. These factors together induce the formation of internal and external male genitalia.		9606

This laminopathic pathway stems from mutations mainly occuring in the LMNA gene can be associated with the onset of other laminopathic syndromes due to a malfunction in the lamin A processing pathway.Other laminopathic diseases are associated with LMNA mutations, thus this pathway represents the overlapping interactions involved in such phenotypic diseases.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4846	SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 pathway		Collaborative project for curation biological processes involved in the COVID-19 disease after SARS-Cov-2 infection. It focuses on experimental evidence and plays with improved annotation of complexes and with the Evidence and Conclusion Ontology. The complexes link to EBI's Complex Portal, resulting from a collaboration with that database at the recent online ELIXIR biohackathon. Editing this pathway is (at this moment) coordinated via the wikipathways.slack.com #sarscov2 channel. Additionally, please feel free to add suggestions to the discussion page (see the tab at the top of this page). The large viral Spike protein (S or surface glycoprotein) forms trimers. It interacts with the host's ACE2 receptor to establish binding (Hoffmann et al 2020). There are suggestions for more than one cell entry mechanism, with the evidence for ACE2/TMPRSS2 entry being most clear now. Lack of expression of TMPRSS2 may explain age differences in COVID19 severity. In this mechanism, to enter the virus needs to be primed by the host protease TMPRSS2 that splits the Spike protein into 2 peptides S1 and S2. S1 contains the ACE2 receptor binding site, S2 binds to the host cell membrane which leads to membrane fusion, the start of the uptake process. The ACE2 receptor interaction was also suggested as the start of specific lung-damaging effects. Other human genes that may be involved in alternative cell uptake mechanisms include CTSL and SLC6A19.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4853	Linoleic acid metabolism affected by SARS-CoV-2		Lipid metabolism alternations that are related to infection by corona viruses. The information comes from the Yan et al. in 2019 in the bibliography, particularly Figure 5. That paper uses the HCoV-229E virus as a model. Note that that is different from the virus that causes the 2020 pandemic SARS-CoV-2. Fig 5 is in turn taken from https://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map00591, which is a very simplified pathway, omitting several steps.The paper mentions that after virus infection many of the metabolites in his figure are increased in concentration.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4856	Intracellular trafficking proteins involved in CMT neuropathy		Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is one of the most common inherited peripheral neuropathies. This peripheral neuropathy is highly heterogeneous (clinically and genetically) and is characterized by a slowly progressive degeneration of the muscle of the foot, lower leg, hand and forearm, accompanied by sensory loss in the toes, fingers and limbs. Mutations in genes involved in intracellular trafficking are increasingly being implicated in various human diseases, including neuronal diseases. This pathway highlights genes with known mutations in CMTs relevant to intracellular trafficking. DNM2 regulates vesicle budding. KIF1B controls vesicle motility on microtubules. LITAF and LRSAM are present in the endocytic pathway and probably regulate protein degradation. Myotubularin-related proteins (MTMR2 and MTMR13) and FIG4 regulate PI metabolism at the level of early endosomes and late endosomes, respectively. Rab7 is present on late endosomes and regulates transport to lysosomes. SH3TC2 regulates endosomal recycling together with Rab11, while NDRG1 regulates membrane traffic at the level of early endosomes together with Rab4 and PRA1. HSPs regulate proteasomal degradation and associate with neurofilaments and actin filaments. FGD4 associates with and regulates actin filaments. MFN2 and GDAP regulate mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial axonal transport.This pathway is based on figure 4 and table 1 from [http://europepmc.org/article/PMC/3514635 Bucci et al].

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4860	Hijack of ubiquitination by SARS-CoV-2		SARS-CoV-2 includes a novel Orf10 that interacts with muliple members of the Cullin 2 ubiquitin ligase complex as determined by AP-MS (Gordon 2020). The strongest interaction is with ZYG11B, a substrate adaptor for CUL2. By binding this complex, Orf10 might be able to hijack its activity. The hijacking of ubiquitination machinery is a common strategy of viruses to direct the degradation of viral restriction factors, for example. Also depicted here is the required neddylation (N8) of CUL2 by the NAE enzyme complex. The ability of this enzyme to transfer N8 to CUL2 is inhibited by the small molecule Pevonedistat.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4861	Endoplasmic reticulum stress response in coronavirus infection		This pathway model describes how the three branches of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) signaling pathway are activated and regulated during human coronavirus infection [DOI: 10.1146/annurev-micro-020518-115759]. During coronavirus infection, viral proteins are produced in large amounts in the ER, exceeding the ER’s protein folding capacity and leading to large amounts of unfolded proteins. This results in ER stress and activation of the UPR through transmembrane sensors PERK, IRE1 and ATF6. Pathways activation occurs when the protein chaperone GRP78 (HSPA5) dissociates from the PERK/IRE1/ATF6 to bind unfolded proteins, which leads to oligomerization, autophosphorylation and activation [DOI: 10.1107/S0907444911006445].Activated PERK inactivates eIF2α by phosphorylation, leading to a decrease in overall protein synthesis. eIF2α can also be phosphorylated by several other kinases (HRI, GCN2, PKR). PKR activation is shown to be suppressed by coronavirus nsp15 and dsRNA-binding activity of MERS-CoV protein 4a. Activated IRE1 (ERN1) has multiple downstream effects. The IRE1 RNase domain is involved in unconventional splicing of XBP1, creating XBP1S which induces expression of protein folding genes. The RNase domain can also break down mRNAs (IRE1-dependent mRNA decay, RIDD), helping to establish ER homeostasis. Finally, the kinase activity of IRE1 also activates a signaling cascade that leads to the JNK pathway, triggering apoptosis. It is thought that the SARS-CoV E protein suppresses activation of the IRE1 pathway and SARS-CoV-induced apoptosis [10.1371/journal.ppat.1002315]. Activated ATF6 is translocated to Golgi and cleaved [DOI: 10.1016/s1097-2765(00)00133-7] to release ATF6-p50, a transcription factor that induces the expression of protein chaperone genes as well as CHOP and XBP1. There is evidence that SARS-CoV infection inhibits ATF6 cleavage [10.1016/j.virol.2009.02.021].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4863	Host-pathogen interaction of human coronaviruses - autophagy		This pathway describes the induction and modulation of the human autophagy system during human coronavirus infection. The information is based on the review of Fung and Liu [10.1146/annurev-micro-020518-115759]. Autophagy is usually a stress mediated defense mechanism and can protect against pathogen infection. On the other hand it is known from several viruses that they can hijack the cellular autophagy system for proliferation [10.1074/jbc.M306124200]. For human coronaviruses it is presumed that coronaviruses stimulate the initiation of autophagy due to infection initiated stress for which PIK3R4 (VPS15), PIK3C3 (VPS34) and BECN1 (beclin1) are key proteins. Additionally, nsp6 (and nsp567 from other virus species than SARS-CoV) inhibit maturation of autolysosomes. Nsp6 is involved in the formation of double membrane vesicles and therefore has side effects on the formation of normal cellular vesicles [10.4161/auto.29309].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4864	Host-pathogen interaction of human coronaviruses - apoptosis		This pathway describes the induction and modulation of the apoptosis system during human coronavirus infection. The information is based on the review of Fung and Liu [10.1146/annurev-micro-020518-115759]. Apoptosis is a highly controlled form of cell death that can be initiated by several internal (DNA damage) and external factors (T-cell death signal). There are some indications that induction of apoptosis in immune cells contribute to the suppression of the host immune system in some human coronavirus infections [10.1128/JVI.00269-12]. SARS-CoV induces caspase-dependent apoptosis by interfering with prosurvival BCL proteins (BCL2, BCL2L1, MCL1) and AKT1 and uses the apoptosis induced cell deconstruction it for replication, although it seems not to be depending on this mechanism for replication [10.1016/j.virusres.2014.09.016].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4868	Type I interferon induction and signaling during SARS-CoV-2 infection		The induction of Type I interferons and signaling is the first response leading to the innate immune reactions during SARS-COV-2 infection. The virus can enter host cells through two mechanisms. If it enters the cell via diffusion mediated by TMPRSS2, the virus ssRNA will be detected by RIG-I and MDA5 in the cytosol. If the virus enters the cell via endocytosis, the spike proteins will be processed by CTSL in the lysosome leading to the detection of ssRNA by TLR3,7 and 9 (PMID 33506952). The extracellular virus can also be detected by TLR2,4 and 6 (PMID 33506952). The higher production of TLR4 in men and the presence of TLR7 on the X chromosome may contribute to the different responses between women and men during SARS-CoV 2 infection (PMID 33506952). TLR7 MYD88-dependent signaling is inhibited at multiple steps by the SARS-CoV Papain-Like Protease (PLpro) domain of nsp3 (red oval). The signaling pathway is critical to induction of type I interferons (INF-I) via IRF3, AP-1 and NFkB transcription factors. INF-I triggers the JAK/STAT pathway leading to the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), such as OAS and PKR, which go one to conduct the innate immune response. TREML4 has been shown to be necessary for MYD88 recruitment by TLR7 and STAT1 participation. The inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro by GRL0617 is proposed based on Ratia, et al. 2008 and 100% sequence identity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 across all 13 residues of PLpro involved in binding GRL0617 (82.9% identity across 316 amino acids) as determined by the alignment of RefSeq YP_009725299.1 and PDB 3E9S (https://alexanderpico.github.io/SARS-CoV-2_Alignments/#Nsp3_PLpro_domain). The antimicrobial agent, azithromycin, is in clincal trials as COVID-19 therapy in combination with hydroxychloroquine (Gautret 2020) has been shown to modulate inflammation by inhibiting the activation of many of these same transcription factors.		9606

CAMKK2 is activated once calmodulin (CALM1) binds with CAAMKK2. The most well-characterized substrates of CaMKK2 are CaMKI, CaMKIV and AMPKÃŽÂ±. CaMKK2 phosphorylates CaMKIV, CaMKI and AMPKÃŽÂ± on activation loop Thr residues (Thr-200, Thr-177 and Thr-172, respectively), which increases their kinase activities (PMID:9822657). CaMKK2 is present in many areas of the brain, including the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, dentate gyrus, amygdala, hypothalamus, and cerebellum (PMID:9822657, 12654522).The creation of this pathway is described in [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33136287/ Najar et al].		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4876	Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome by SARS-CoV-2		"Orf3a from SARS-CoV has been shown to bind TRAF3 and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. The activation occurs at two points. First, by ubiquinating NF-kB (p105) to stimulate its proteolytic processing into mature NF-kB (p50), which can then go on to promote the transcription of pro-IL-1B together with RELA (p65). And second, by ubiquitinating ASC (PYCARD) in the NLRP3 inflammasome, which leads to its degradtion and the activation of caspase-1 (CASP1) that goes on to catalyze the production of mature IL-1B, leading to a cytokine storm. While Orf3a of SARS-CoV-2 only has 72.7% sequence identity with that of SARS-CoV, the TRAF3 binding motif PxQxS is 100% conserved (https://alexanderpico.github.io/SARS-CoV-2_Alignments/#Orf3a).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4877	Host-pathogen interaction of human coronaviruses - MAPK signaling		This pathway describes the activation of the human MAPK signaling system during human coronavirus infection, per Fung and Liu, Figure 7 [10.1146/annurev-micro-020518-115759]. The MAPK signaling system regulates response to different environmental stimuli, e.g. inflammation due to infection. Its downstream effects include regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis, differentiation and immune response. During coronavirus infection, three MAPK signaling pathways were studied and described. The p38 pathway (MAPK11 - MAPK14) leads to stimulation of apoptosis via CHOP (DDIT3) while the ERK pathway (MAPK1 and MAPK3) counteracts apoptosis stimulation and supports cell survival by stimulating ATF2 and FOS. The JNK pathway (MAPK 8 - MAPK10) inhibits cell survival protein BCL2, thus stimulating apoptosis but also stimulating the AP1 complex that leads to the production of effectors to fight the infection. The interplay of apoptosis stimulation and cell survival is not yet fully understood in SARS-CoV-2 infection.		9606

The antimicrobial agent, azithromycin, is in clinical trials as COVID-19 therapy in combination with hydroxychloroquine (Gautret 2020) has been shown to modulate inflammation by inhibiting the activation of many of these same transcription factors.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4883	SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptor: molecular mechanisms		For initial entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into cells, the large viral Spike (S) protein needs to be primed by host proteases. For SARS-CoV-2 that is the serine protease TMPRSS2. After binding to its functional receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the virus undergoes endocytosis. After endocytosis of the viral complex, surface ACE2 is further down-regulated, resulting in unopposed angiotensin 2 accumulation. Local activation of the angiotensin pathway system may mediate lung injury responses to viral insults. ACE denotes angiotensin-converting enzyme and ARB angiotensin-receptor blocker.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP49	IL-2 signaling pathway		IL-2 is a multifunctional cytokine with pleiotropic effects on several cells of the immune system. IL-2 was originally discovered as a T cell growth factor, but it was also found to have actions related to B cell proliferation, and cytolytic activity of natural killer cells. IL-2 also activates lymphokine activated killer cells. In contrast to its proliferative effects, IL-2 also has potent activity in a process known as activation-induced cell death. More recently, IL-2 was shown to promote tolerance through its effects on regulatory T cell development. IL-2 clinically has anti-cancer effects as well as utility in supporting T cell numbers in HIV/AIDS. There are three classes of IL-2 receptors, binding IL-2 with low, intermediate, or high-affinity. The low affinity receptor (IL-2RÃŽÂ± alone) is not functional; signaling by IL-2 involves either the high affinity hetero-trimeric receptor containing IL-2RÃŽÂ±, IL-2RÃŽÂ² and the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (originally named IL-2RÃŽÂ³ and now generally denoted as ÃŽÂ³c) or the intermediate affinity heterodimeric receptor composed of IL-2RÃŽÂ² and ÃŽÂ³c. IL-2 stimulation induces the activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK3, which associate with IL-2RÃŽÂ² and ÃŽÂ³c, respectively. These kinases in turn phosphorylate IL-2RÃŽÂ² and induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) and various other downstream targets. The downstream signaling pathways activated by IL-2 also involves mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling modules, leading to both mitogenic and anti-apoptotic signals.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_2_pathway.html NetSlim] database.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP497	Urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups		The urea cycle (also known as the ornithine cycle) is a cycle of biochemical reactions that produces urea ((NH2)2CO) from ammonia (NH3). This cycle occurs in ureotelic organisms. The urea cycle converts highly toxic ammonia to urea for excretion. This cycle was the first metabolic cycle to be discovered (Hans Krebs and Kurt Henseleit, 1932), five years before the discovery of the TCA cycle. The urea cycle takes place primarily in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the kidneys. Amino acid catabolism results in waste ammonia. All animals need a way to excrete this product. Most aquatic organisms, or ammonotelic organisms, excrete ammonia without converting it. Ammonia is toxic, but upon excretion from aquatic species, it is diluted by the water outside the organism. Organisms that cannot easily and safely remove nitrogen as ammonia convert it to a less toxic substance such as urea or uric acid. The urea cycle mainly occurs in the liver. The urea produced by the liver is then released into the bloodstream where it travels to the kidneys and is ultimately excreted in urine. In species including birds and most insects, the ammonia is converted into uric acid or its urate salt, which is excreted in solid form.Source description: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea_cycle Wikipedia]Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP497 CPTAC Assay Portal].		9606

Galaninergic signaling is predominantly inhibitory which mainly involves MAPK, AKT, AC pathways Galanin peptides have a wide range of non-neuronal functions as well as classic neuromodulatory roles, therefore it is recommended to consider as regulatory peptides.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4973	Urea cycle		The urea cycle yields urea, the major form in which excess nitrogen is excreted from the human body, and the amino acid arginine (Brusilow and Horwich 2001). It consists of four reactions: that of ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to form citrulline, of citrulline and aspartate to form argininosuccinate, the cleavage of argininosuccinate to yield fumarate and arginine, and the cleavage of arginine to yield urea and re-form ornithine. The carbamoyl phosphate consumed in this cycle is synthesized in the mitochondria from bicarbonate and ammonia, and this synthesis in turn is dependent on the presence of N-acetylglutamate, which allosterically activates carbamoyl synthetase I enzyme. The synthesis of N-acetylglutamate is stimulated by high levels of arginine. Increased levels of free amino acids, indicated by elevated arginine levels, thus stimulate urea synthesis.<p>Two enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of arginine to yield ornithine and urea. Cytosolic ARG1 is the canonical urea cycle enzyme. Mitochondrial ARG2 likewise catalyzes urea production from arginine and may have a substantial sparing effect in patients lacking ARG1 enzyme, so its reaction is annotated here although the role of ARG2 under normal physiological conditions remains unclear.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4974	Alpha-protein kinase 1 signaling pathway		Immune recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRR) often activates proinflammatory nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB) signalling. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a well-known PAMP produced by gram-negative bacteria. LPS is recognized by toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) and is a strong activator of NF-ÎºB inflammatory responses (Akashi S et al. 2003). LPS is also recognized in the cytosol by mouse caspase-11 and related human caspase-4 and caspase-5, which stimulate pyroptosis, a proinflammatory form of cell death (Kayagaki N et al. 2011; Shi J et al. 2015). Key metabolic intermediates in LPS biosynthesis, d-glycero-Î²-d-manno-heptose 1,7-bisphosphate (HBP) and ADP L-glycero-Î²-d-manno-heptose (ADP-heptose) were reported to activate the NF-ÎºB pathway and trigger the innate immune responses (Milivojevic M et al. 2017; Zimmermann S et al. 2017; Zhou P et al. 2018; GarcÃ­a-Weber D; 2018). ADP-heptose but not HBP can enter host cells autonomously (Zhou P et al. 2018). During infection, ADP-heptose or HBP translocate into the host cytosol where their presence is sensed by alpha-protein kinase 1 (ALPK1) (Zimmermann S et al. 2017; Zhou P et al. 2018). ADP-heptose directly binds and activates ALPK1 (Garcia-Weber D et al. 2018; Zhou P et al. 2018); instead, HBP is converted by host-derived adenylyltransferases, such as nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferases, to ADP-heptose 7-P, a substrate which can then activate ALPK1 (Zhou P et al. 2018). The ADP-heptose binding to ALPK1 is thought to trigger conformational changes and stimulate the kinase domain of ALPK1 (Zhou P et al. 2018). ALPK1 kinase activity in turn leads to the phosphorylation-dependent oligomerization of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF-Î±) receptorâ€“associated factor (TRAF)â€“interacting protein with the forkhead-associated domain (TIFA) (Zimmermann S et al. 2017; Zhou P et al. 2018). This process activates TRAF6 oligomerization and ubiquitination, and the recruitment of transforming growth factor Î²-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-binding protein 2 (TAB2), a component of the TAK1 (MAP3K7) complex (Ea CK et al. 2004; Gaudet RG et al. 2017). This TIFA oligomer signaling platform was given the term: TIFAsome. TIFAsome-activated TAK1 induces NF-ÎºB nuclear translocation and proinflammatory gene expression. The ALPK1-TIFA signaling pathway has been identified in human embryonic kidney cells, intestinal epithelial cells, gastric cells and cervical cancer cells (Gaudet RG et al. 2015, 2017; Stein SC et al. 2017; Gall A et al. 2017; Zimmermann S et al. 2017; Milivojevic M et al. 2017; Zhou P et al. 2018). In vivo studies demonstrate that ADP-heptose and Burkholderia cenocepacia trigger massive inflammatory responses with increased production of several NF-ÎºB-dependent cytokines and chemokines in wild type (WT), but not in Alpk1-/- mice (Zhou P et al. 2018).<p>This Reactome module describes ALPK1 as a cytosolic innate immune receptor for bacterial ADP-heptose.

Phosphorylated EIF2S1 reduces translation of most mRNAs but increases translation of downstream ORFs in mRNAs such as ATF4 that contain upstream ORFs (inferred from mouse homologs in Vattem and Wek 2004, reviewed in Hinnebusch et al. 2016, Sonenberg and Hinnebusch 2009). ATF4, in turn, activates expression of genes involved in responding to amino acid deficiency such as DDIT3 (CHOP), ASNS (asparagine synthetase), CEBPB, and ATF3 (reviewed in Kilberg et al. 2012, Wortel et al. 2017). In mice, EIF2AK4 in the brain may responsible for avoidance of diets lacking essential amino acids (Hao et al. 2005, Maurin et al. 2005, see also Leib and Knight 2015, Gietzen et al. 2016, reviewed in Dever and Hinnebusch 2005).<br>EIF2AK4 is bound to both the ribosome and GCN1, which is required for activation of EIF2AK4 and may act by shuttling uncharged tRNAs from the A site of the ribosome to EIF2AK4. Upon binding tRNA, EIF2AK4 trans-autophosphorylates. Phosphorylated EIF2AK4 then phosphorylates EIF2S1 on serine-52, the same serine residue phosphorylated by other kinases of the integrated stress response: EIF2AK1 (HRI, activated by heme deficiency and other stresses), EIF2AK2 (PKR, activated by double-stranded RNA), and EIF2AK3 (PERK, activated by unfolded proteins) (reviewed in Hinnebusch 1994, Wek et al. 2006, Donnelly et al. 2013, Pakos-Zebrucka et al. 2016, Wek 2018),  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=9633012 Reactome].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4976	Late endosomal microautophagy		Microautophagy (MI) is a non-selective autophagic pathway that involves internalisation of cytosolic cargo through invaginations of the lysosomal membrane. MI can be induced by nitrogen starvation and complements other related self-eating processes such as Macroautophagy (MA) and Chaperone Mediated Autophagy (CMA). MI can degrade cell organelles and bulk cytosolic proteins directly via the lysosome and late endosome. MI can also target substrates with KFERQ motifs with the help of HSPA8 (Li W W et al. 2012).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4977	Extra-nuclear estrogen signaling		In addition to its well-characterized role in estrogen-dependent transcription, estrogen (beta-estradiol, also known as E2) also plays a rapid, non-genomic role through interaction with receptors localized at the plasma membrane by virtue of dynamic palmitoylation. Estrogen receptor palmitoylation is a prerequisite for the E2-dependent activation of extra-nuclear signaling both in vitro and in animal models (Acconcia et al, 2004; Acconcia et al, 2005; Marino et al, 2006; Marino and Ascenzi, 2006). Non-genomic signaling through the estrogen receptor ESR1 also depends on receptor arginine methylation by PMRT1 (Pedram et al, 2007; Pedram et al, 2012; Le Romancer et al, 2008; reviewed in Arnal, 2017; Le Romancer et al, 2011 ). <br>E2-evoked extra-nuclear signaling is independent of the transcriptional activity of estrogen receptors and occurs within seconds to minutes following E2 administration to target cells. Extra-nuclear signaling consists of the activation of a plethora of signaling pathways including the RAF/MAP kinase cascade and the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade and governs processes such as  apoptosis, cellular proliferation and metastasis (reviewed in Hammes et al, 2007; Handa et al, 2012; Lange et al, 2007; Losel et al, 2003; Arnal et al, 2017; Le Romancer et al, 2011). ESR-mediated signaling also cross-talks with receptor tyrosine kinase, NF- kappa beta and GPCR signaling pathways by modulating the post-translational modification of enzymes and other proteins and regulating second messengers (reviewed in Arnal et al, 2017; Schwartz et al, 2016; Boonyaratanakornkit, 2011; Biswas et al, 2005). In the nervous system, E2 affects neural functions such as cognition, behaviour, stress responses and reproduction in part by inducing such rapid extra-nuclear responses (Farach-Carson and Davis, 2003; Losel et al, 2003), while in endothelial cells, non-genomic ESR-dependent signaling also regulates vasodilation through the eNOS pathway (reviewed in Levin, 2011). <br>Extra-nuclear signaling additionally cross-talks with nuclear estrogen receptor signaling and is required to control ER protein stability (La Rosa et al, 2012)<br>Recent data have demonstrated that the membrane ESR1 can interact with various endocytic proteins to traffic and signal within the cytoplasm. This receptor intracellular trafficking appears to be dependent on the phyical interaction of ESR1 with specific trans-membrane receptors such as IGR-1R and beta 1-integrin (Sampayo et al, 2018) View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=9009391 Reactome].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4978	Response of EIF2AK1 (HRI) to heme deficiency		The kinases of the integrated stress response phosphorylate EIF2S1 (eIF2-alpha) to regulate cellular translation. The kinases comprise PERK (also called EIF2AK3), which responds to unfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum; EIF2AK2 (also called PKR), which responds to cytosolic double-stranded RNA; EIF2AK4 (also called GCN2), which responds to amino acid deficiency; and EIF2AK1 (also called heme-regulated inhibitor, HRI, and heme-controlled repressor, HCR), which responds to heme deficiency and cytosolic unfolded protein. Each molecule of EIF2AK1 binds two molecules of heme, one bound near the N-terminus and one bound at the kinase insert (KI) domain that inhibits the kinase activity of EIF2AK1 (inferred from the rabbit homolog in Chefalo et al. 1998, Rafie-Kolpin et al. 2000, inferred from the mouse homolog in Misanova et al. 2006, Hirai et al. 2007, Igarashi et al. 2008). Dissociation of heme from the KI domain activates the kinase activity of EIF2AK1, which autophosphorylates (inferred from the mouse homolog in Bauer et al. 2001, Rafie-Kolpin et al. 2003, Igarashi et al. 2011) and then phosphorylates EIF2S1 (Bhavnani et al. 2018, inferred from the rabbit homologs in Chefalo et al. 1998, Rafie-Kolpin et al. 2000, inferred from the mouse homologs in Lu et al. 2001, Rafie-Kolpin et al. 2003, Igarashi et al. 2011).<br>Phosphorylated EIFS1 causes a reduction in general cellular translation and thereby coordinates globin synthesis with heme availability during erythropoiesis (inferred from mouse knockout in Han et al. 2001, reviewed in Chen et al. 2014). Translation of mitochondrial and cytosolic ribosomal proteins is most severely reduced, causing a decrease in cellular protein synthesis (inferred from mouse homologs in Zhang et al. 2019). Lack of EIF2AK1 causes accumulation of unfolded globins devoid of heme and consequent anemia in iron-deficient mice (inferred from mouse knockout in Han et al. 2001). Activation of the cytoplasmic unfolded protein response and impaired mitochondrial respiration are also observed in HRI deficiency (inferred from mouse homologs in Zhang et al. 2019).<br>Phosphorylation of EIFS1 activates translation of certain mRNAs such as ATF4, ATF5, and DDIT3 (CHOP) that have upstream ORFs (inferred from mouse homologs in Harding et al. 2000). ATF4 in turn activates programs of gene expression that ameliorate effects of the stress to maintain mitochondrial function, redox homeostasis, and erythroid differentiation (inferred from mouse homologs in Zhang et al. 2019). Unresolved stress, however, can eventually lead to apoptosis regulated by DDIT3. EIF2AK1 also represses mTORC1 (mechanistic target of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) signaling via ATF4-mediated induction of GRB10 as a feedback mechanism to attenuate erythropoietin-mTORC1-stimulated ineffective erythropoiesis in iron deficiency anemia (inferred from mouse homologs in Zhang et al. 2018 and Zhang et. al. 2019).<br>EIF2AK1 is also activated by heat shock, arsenite (oxidative stress), and osmotic stress (inferred from mouse homologs in Lu et al. 2001). The mechanisms by which these stresses act on EIF2AK1 are independent of heme but are not yet fully elucidated. Furthermore, EIF2AK1 is involved in the production of human fetal hemoglobin, and EIF2AK1-mediated stress response has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for hemoglobinopathies (reviewed in Chen and Zhang 2019).<br>In addition to regulation of erythropoiesis, EIF2AK1 shows effects outside of the erythroid lineage, including requirement for the maturation and functions of macrophages (inferred from mouse homologs in Liu et al. 2007),  reduction in endoplasmic reticulum stress in hepatocytes, activation of hepatic expression of fibroblast growth factor, and mediation of translation of GRIN2B (GluN2B. a subunit of the NMDA receptor) and BACE1 in the nervous system (reviewed in Burwick and Aktas 2017). HRI-integrated stress response is activated in human cancer cell lines and primary multiple myeloma cells, and has emerged as a molecular target of anticancer agents  (reviewed in Burwick and Aktas 2017; reviewed in Chen and Zhang 2019).

In rat PC12 cells, a common model for NGF signaling, stimulation with NGF causes cells to exit the cell cycle and undergo a differentiation program leading to neurite outgrowth. This program is driven by the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs), which frequently encode transcription factors regulating the activity of NGF-specific delayed response genes (reviewed in Sheng and Greenberg, 1990; Flavell and Grennberg, 2008; Santiago and Bashaw, 2014).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4984	FOXO-mediated transcription of cell death genes		FOXO transcription factors promote expression of several pro-apoptotic genes, such as FASLG (Brunet et al. 1999, Ciechomska et al. 2003, Chen et al. 2013, Li et al. 2015), PINK1 (Mei et al. 2009, Sengupta et al. 2011), BCL2L11 (BIM) (Gilley et al. 2003, Urbich et al. 2005, Chuang et al. 2007, Hughes et al. 2011, Chen et al. 2013, Wang et al. 2016), BCL6 (Tang et al. 2002, Fernandez de Mattos et al. 2004, Shore et al. 2006) and BBC3 (PUMA) (Dudgeon et al. 2010, Hughes et al. 2011, Liu et al. 2015, Wu et al. 2016, Liu et al. 2017, Fitzwalter et al. 2018). FOXO-mediated induction of cell death genes is important during development, for example during nervous system development, where FOXO promotes neuronal death upon NGF withdrawal (Gilley et al. 2003), and also contributes to the tumor-suppressive role of FOXO factors (Arimoto Ishida et al. 2004). FOXO1 transcriptional activity is implicated in the cell death of enteric nervous system (ENS) precursors. RET signaling, which activates PI3K/AKT signaling, leading to inhibition of FOXO mediated transcription, ensures survival of ENS precursors (Srinivasan et al. 2005).<br>Transcription of the STK11 (LKB1) gene, encoding Serine/threonine-protein kinase STK11 (also known as Liver kinase B1), which regulates diverse cellular processes, including apoptosis, is directly stimulated by FOXO3 and FOXO4 (Lutzner et al. 2012).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4985	Lipophagy		Triglycerides stored in lipid droplets are hydrolysed under nutrient starvation to release fatty acids for energy. The content of lipid droplets may vary but they are all coated with a protective protein called perilipin. When this protein is degraded, lipid droplets associate with autophagic components and breakdown into fatty acids (Ward C et al. 2016, Schulze R J et al. 2017). This process is termed as lipophagy (Singh R et al. 2009). View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=9613354 Reactome].		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4986	Aggrephagy		When the capacity of the proteosome to degrade misfolded proteins is limited, the alternate route to eliminate denatured proteins is via forming aggresomes - a process known as aggrephagy. Aggresome formation starts with ubiquitination of misfolded proteins following transport to the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) with the help of dynein motor proteins. At the MTOC the cargo is encapsulated with intermediate filament proteins to result in the aggresome. Subsequently, this aggresome recruits chaperones that result in its autophagic elimination (Garcia Mata R et al. 2002).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4987	Class I peroxisomal membrane protein import		Most peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) are inserted into the peroxisomal membrane by the receptor-chaperone PEX19 and the docking receptor PEX3 (Soukupova et al. 1999, Muntau et al. 2003, Fang et al. 2004, Fujiki et al. 2006, Matsuzono and Fujiki 2006, Matsuzono et al. 2006, Pinto et al. 2006, Sato et al. 2008, Sato et al. 2010, Schmidt et al. 2010, Hattula et al. 2014, reviewed in Fujiki et al. 2014, Mayerhofer 2016). PEX19 binds the PMP as it is translated in the cytosol. Recognition of the PMP by PEX 19 appears to depend on positively charged residues in the transmembrane domain of the PMP (Costello et al. 2017). The PEX19:PMP complex then interacts with PEX3 located in the peroxisomal membrane. Through a mechanism that is not yet clear, the PMP is inserted into the peroxisomal membrane and PEX19 dissociates from PEX3. A current model involves transfer of the PMP from PEX19 to a hydrophobic region of PEX3 followed by insertion of the PMP into the membrane (Chen et al. 2014, reviewed by Giannopoulou et al. 2016). The process does not appear to require hydrolysis of ATP or GTP (Pinto et al. 2006).<br>Unlike other PMPs, PEX3 is inserted into the peroxisomal membrane by binding PEX19 and then docking with PEX16 (Matsuzaki and Fujiki 2008). Both PEX3 and PEX16 can also be co-translationally inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Kim et al. 2006, Yonekawa et al. 2011, Aranovich et al. 2014, Hua et al. 2015, Mayerhofer et al. 2016). This region of the ER membrane then buds to contribute to new peroxisomes. PEX3 is also observed to insert into the mitochondrial outer membrane (Sugiura et al. 2017). Regions of the ER membrane and mitochondrial outer membrane are then released to form pre-peroxisomal vesicles which fuse to form new peroxisomes (Sugiura et al. 2017). Peroxisomes therefore appear to arise from fission of existing peroxisomes and production of new peroxisomes from precursors derived from mitochondria and the ER (Sugiura et al. 2017, reviewed in Fujiki et al. 2014, Hua and Kim 2016).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4989	FOXO-mediated transcription of cell cycle genes		FOXO transcription factors induce expression of several genes that negatively regulate proliferation of different cell types, such as erythroid progenitors (Bakker et al. 2004, Wang et al. 2015) and neuroepithelial progenitor cells in the telencephalon (Seoane et al. 2004).<br>Transcription of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors CDKN1A (p21Cip1) is directly stimulated by FOXO1, FOXO3 and FOXO4 (Seoane et al. 2004, Tinkum et al. 2013). FOXO transcription factors can cooperate with the SMAD2/3:SMAD4 complex to induce CDKN1A transcription in response to TGF-beta signaling (Seoane et al. 2004).<br>FOXO transcription factors FOXO1, FOXO3 and FOXO4 stimulate transcription of the CDKN1B (p27Kip1) gene, but direct binding of FOXOs to the CDKN1B gene locus has not been demonstrated (Dijkers et al. 2000, Medema et al. 2000, Lees et al. 2008).<br>FOXO3 and FOXO4, and possibly FOXO1, directly stimulate transcription of the GADD45A  gene (Tran et al. 2002, Furukawa Hibi et al. 2002, Hughes et al. 2011, Sengupta et al. 2011, Ju et al. 2014).<br>Transcription of the retinoblastoma family protein RBL2 (p130), involved in the maintenance of quiescent (G0) state, is directly stimulated by FOXO1, FOXO3 and FOXO4 (Kops et al. 2002, Chen et al. 2006).<br>Transcription of the anti-proliferative protein CCNG2 is directly stimulated by FOXO1 and FOXO3, and possibly FOXO4 (Martinez Gac et al. 2004, Chen et al. 2006). Transcription of the anti-proliferative protein BTG1 is directly stimulated by FOXO3 (Bakker et al. 2004, Bakker et al. 2007, Wang et al. 2015).<br>Transcription of CAV1, encoding caveolin-1, involved in negative regulation of growth factor receptor signaling and establishment of quiescent cell phenotype, is directly stimulated by FOXO1 and FOXO3 (van den Heuvel et al. 2005, Roy et al. 2008, Nho et al. 2013, Sisci et al. 2013).<br>FOXO1 and FOXO3 promote transcription of the KLF4 gene, encoding a transcription factor Krueppel-like factor 4, which inhibits proliferation of mouse B cells (Yusuf et al. 2008).<br> FOXO1, together with the p-2S-SMAD2/3:SMAD4 complex, stimulates transcription of the MSTN gene, encoding myostatin, a TGF-beta family member that stimulates differentiation of myoblasts (Allen and Unterman 2007).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4991	Events associated with phagocytolytic activity of PMN cells		When neutrophils engulf bacteria they enclose them in small vacuoles (phagosomes) into which superoxide is released by activated NADPH oxidase (NOX2) on the internalized neutrophil membrane. The directional nature of NOX2 activity creates a charge imbalance that must be counteracted to prevent depolarization of the membrane and the shutdown of activity (Winterbourn CC et al. 2016). Also, protons are produced in the cytosol and consumed in the external compartment (for example, the phagosome) through the dismutation of superoxide. Both situations are largely overcome by a balancing flow of protons transported by voltage-gated proton channels, primarily VSOP/HV1, which are activated in parallel with the oxidase (Demaurex N & El Chemaly A 2010; El Chemaly A et al. 2010; Petheo GL et al. 2010; Kovacs I et al. 2014; Henderson LM et al. 1987, 1988). The pH of the phagosome is regulated by these activities. In contrast to the phagosomes of macrophages, in which pH drops following particle ingestion, neutrophil phagosomes remain alkaline during the period that the oxidase is active. Until recently, their pH has been accepted to lie between 7.5 and 8. However, in a 2015 study using a probe that is more sensitive at higher pH, an average pH closer to 9 was measured in individual phagosomes (Levine AP et al. 2015).<p>The superoxide dismutates to hydrogen peroxide, which is used by myeloperoxidase (MPO) to generate other oxidants, including the highly microbicidal species such as hypochlorous acid (Winterbourn CC et al. 2013, 2016).

Transamination, the conversion of an amino acid to the corresponding alpha-keto acid coupled to the conversion of a molecule of 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) to glutamate, is the first step in the catabolism of most amino acids. Transamination reactions are freely reversible so they also provide a means to balance concentrations of various amino acids and 2-oxo (alpha-keto) acids in the cell (Felig 1975; HÃ¤ussinger 1990; Owen et al. 1979).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4995	Transcriptional regulation by VENTX		The VENTX (also known as VENT homeobox or VENTX2) gene is a member of the homeobox family of transcription factors. The ortholog of VENTX was first described in Xenopus where it participates in BMP and Nanog signaling pathways and controls dorsoventral mesoderm patterning (Onichtchouk et al. 1996, Scerbo et al. 2012). The zebrafish ortholog of VENTX is also involved in dorsoventral patterning in the early embryo (Imai et al. 2001). Rodents lack the VENTX ortholog (Zhong and Holland 2011). VENTX is expressed in human blood cells (Moretti et al. 2001) and appears to play an important role in hematopoiesis. The role of VENTX in hematopoiesis was first suggested based on its role in mesoderm patterning in Xenopus and zebrafish (Davidson and Zon 2000). VENTX promotes cell cycle arrest and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells and/or progenitor cells (Wu, Gao, Ke, Giese and Zhu 2011, Wu et al. 2014). Ventx suppression leads to expansion of hematopoietic stem cells and multi-progenitor cells (Gao et, J. Biol.Chem, 2012). VENTX induces transcription of cell cycle inhibitors TP53 (p53) and p16INK4A  and activates tumor suppressor pathways regulated by TP53 and p16INK4A (Wu, Gao, Ke, Hager et al. 2011), as well as macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor (CSF1R) (Wu, Gao, Ke, Giese and Zhu 2011) and inhibits transcription of cyclin D1 (CCND1) (Gao et al. 2010) and Interleukin-6 (IL6) (Wu et al. 2014). Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that EGR3 transcription factor directly binds to the promoter of IL6 and IL8 genes (Baron VT et al, BJC 2015). While VENTX expression may suppress lymphocytic leukemia (Gao et al. 2010), high levels of VENTX have been reported in acute myeloid leukemia cells, with a positive effect on their proliferation (Rawat et al. 2010). Another homeobox transcription factor that regulates differentiation of hematopoietic stemm cells is DLX4 (Bon et al. 2015). Studies on colon cancer showed that VentX regulates tumor associated macrophages and reverts immune suppression in tumor microenvironment (Le et al. 2018). MEK1 is required for Xenopus Ventx2 asymmetric distribution during blastula cell division. Ventx2 inhibition by MEK1 is required for embryonic cell commitment (Scerbo et al, eLife, 2017). VENTX induces TP53-independent apoptosis in cancer cells (Gao H, Oncotarget, 2016). During  Xenopus embryonic development, VENTX ortholog regulates transcription of the sox3 gene (Rogers et al. 2007) as well as the early neuronal gene zic3 (Umair et al. 2018).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4996	Carnitine synthesis		Carnitine is synthesized in four steps from trimethyllysine (generated in turn by the S-adenosyl-methionine-mediated methylation of lysine residues in proteins, followed by protein hydrolysis). The enzymes that catalyze the first three steps of carnitine synthesis, converting trimethyllysine to gamma-butyrobetaine, are widely distributed in human tissues. The enzyme that catalyzes the last reaction, converting gamma-butyrobetaine to carnitine, is found only in liver and kidney cells, and at very low levels in brain tissues.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4997	Blood group systems biosynthesis		The association between blood type and disease has been studied since the beginning of the 20th Century (Anstee 2010, Ewald & Sumner 2016). Landsteiner's discovery of blood groups in 1900 was based on agglutination patterns of red blood cells when blood types from different donors were mixed (Landsteiner 1931, Owen 2000, Tan & Graham 2013). His work is the basis of routine compatibility testing and transfusion practices today. The immune system of patients receiving blood transfusions will attack any donor red blood cells that contain antigens that differ from their self-antigens. Therefore, matching blood types is essential for safe blood transfusions. Landsteiner's classification of the ABO blood groups confirmed that  antigens were inherited characteristics. In the 1940s, it was established that the specificity of blood group antigens was determined by their unique oligosaccharide structures. Since then, exponential advances in technology have resulted in the identification of over 300 blood group antigens, classified into more than 35 blood group systems by the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) (Storry et al. 2016).<br><br>Blood group antigens comprise either a protein portion or oligosaccharide sequence attached on a glycolipid or glycoprotein. The addition of one or more specific sugar molecules to this oligosaccharide sequence at specific positions by a variety of glycosyltransferases results in the formation of mature blood group antigens. The genes that code for glycosytransferases can contain genetic changes that produce antigenic differences, resulting in new antigens or loss of expression. Blood group antigens are found on red blood cells (RBCs), platelets, leukocytes, and plasma proteins and also exist in soluble form in bodily secretions such as breast milk, seminal fluid, saliva, sweat, gastric secretions and urine. Blood groups are implicated in many diseases such as those related to malignancy (Rummel & Ellsworth 2016), the cardiovascular system (Liumbruno & Franchini 2013), metabolism (Meo et al. 2016, Ewald & Sumner 2016) and infection (Rios & Bianco 2000, McCullough 2014). The most important and best-studied blood groups are the ABO, Lewis and Rhesus systems. The biosynthesis of the antigens in these systems is described in this section.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4998	Cell recruitment (pro-inflammatory response)		Migration of immune cells is orchestrated by a fine balance of cytokine and chemokine responses. During Leishmania macrophage interaction, either pro inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines are produced, having an impact in the establishment of infection and further clinical outcome (Navas et al. 2014). Toll like receptors, GPCRs such as the purinergic receptors P2YRs, complement receptor 3A and interleukin receptor 15 amongst others, have been associated with the production of pro inflammatory cytokines (Lai and Gallo 2012 & Cekic et al. 2016). A strong pro inflammatory response in the acute phase of the infection helps to control the parasite load when the recruited cells enhance microbiocidal mechanisms. However, alterations in the chemokine network may contribute to uncontrolled immune responses that can modulate parasite survival and promote or mitigate the associated immunopathology, thereby influencing the outcome of infection (Navas et al. 2014).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4999	FOXO-mediated transcription of oxidative stress, metabolic and neuronal genes		FOXO6, the least studied member of the FOXO family, directly stimulates transcription of PLXNA4 gene, encoding a co-factor for the semaphorin SEMA3A receptor. FOXO6-mediated regulation of PLXNA4 expression plays an important role in radial glia migration during cortical development (Paap et al. 2016).<br>FOXO-mediated up-regulation of genes involved in reduction of the oxidative stress burden is not specific to neurons, but plays an important role in neuronal survival and neurodegenerative diseases. FOXO3 and FOXO4, and possibly FOXO1, directly stimulate transcription of the SOD2 gene, encoding mitochondrial manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase, which converts superoxide to the less harmful hydrogen peroxide and oxygen (Kops et al. 2002, Hori et al. 2013, Araujo et al. 2011, Guan et al. 2016). FOXO4 stimulates SOD2 gene transcription in collaboration with ATXN3, a protein involved in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) (Araujo et al. 2011). FOXO3 and FOXO6, and possibly FOXO1, directly stimulate transcription of the CAT gene, encoding catalase, an enzyme that converts hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, thus protecting cells from the oxidative stress (Awad et al. 2014, Kim et al. 2014, Rangarajan et al. 2015, Song et al. 2016, Liao et al. 2016, Guo et al. 2016).<br>FOXO transcription factors regulate transcription of several genes whose protein products are secreted from hypothalamic neurons to control appetite and food intake: NPY gene, AGRP gene and POMC gene. At low insulin levels, characteristic of starvation, FOXO transcription factors bind to insulin responsive elements (IRES) in the regulatory regions of NPY, AGRP and POMC gene. FOXO1 directly stimulates transcription of the NPY gene, encoding neuropeptide-Y (Kim et al. 2006, Hong et al. 2012), and the AGRP gene, encoding Agouti-related protein (Kitamura et al. 2006, Kim et al. 2006), which both stimulate food intake. At the same time, FOXO1 directly represses transcription of the POMC gene, encoding melanocyte stimulating hormone alpha , which suppresses food intake (Kitamura et al. 2006, Kim et al. 2006). When, upon food intake, blood insulin levels rise, insulin-mediated activation of PI3K/AKT signaling inhibits FOXO transcriptional activity.<br>In liver cells, FOXO transcription factors regulate transcription of genes involved in gluconeogenesis: G6PC gene, encoding glucose-6-phosphatase and PCK1 gene, encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Actions of G6PC and PCK1 enable steady glucose blood levels during fasting. FOXO1, FOXO3 and FOXO4 directly stimulate PCK1 gene transcription (Hall et al. 2000, Yang et al. 2002, Puigserver et al. 2003), while all four FOXOs, FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4 and FOXO6 directly stimulate G6PC gene transcription (Yang et al. 2002, Puigserver et al. 2003, Onuma et al. 2006, Kim et al. 2011). FOXO-mediated induction of G6PC and PCK1 genes is negatively regulated by insulin-induced PI3K/AKT signaling.<br>FOXO1, FOXO3 and FOXO4 directly stimulate transcription of the IGFBP1 gene, encoding insulin growth factor binding protein 2 (Tang et al. 1999, Kops et al. 1999, Hall et al. 2000, Yang et al. 2002), which increases sensitivity of cells to insulin.<br>FOXO1 and FOXO3 directly stimulate transcription of the ABCA6 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family A member 6) gene, encoding a putative transporter protein that is thought to be involved in lipid homeostasis (Gai et al. 2013). The GCK (glucokinase) gene is another gene involved in lipid homeostasis that is regulated by FOXOs. FOXO1, acting with the SIN3A:HDAC complex, directly represses the GCK gene transcription, thus repressing lipogenesis in the absence of insulin (Langlet et al. 2017). The SREBF1 (SREBP1) gene, which encodes a transcriptional activator required for lipid homeostasis, is directly transcriptionally repressed by FOXO1 (Deng et al. 2012). Transcription of the RETN gene, encoding resistin, an adipocyte specific hormone that suppresses insulin-mediated uptake of glucose by adipose cells, is directly stimulated by FOXO1 (Liu et al. 2014).<br>Transcription of two genes encoding E3 ubiquitin ligases FBXO32 (Atrogin-1) and TRIM63 (MURF1), involved in degradation of muscle proteins and muscle wasting during starvation, is positively regulated by FOXO transcription factors (Sandri et al. 2004, Waddell et al. 2008, Raffaello et al. 2010, Senf et al. 2011, Bollinger et al. 2014, Wang et al. 2017).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP500	Glycogen synthesis and degradation		"Glycogen is a very large, branched polymer of glucose residues. Within skeletal muscle and liver glucose is stored as glycogen. In the liver, glycogen synthesis and degradation are regulated to maintain blood-glucose levels as required to meet the needs of the organism as a whole. In contrast, in muscle, these processes are regulated to meet the energy needs of the muscle itself. '''Glycogen synthesis''' is, unlike its breakdown, endergonic. This means that glycogen synthesis requires the input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from UTP, which reacts with glucose-1-phosphate, forming UDP-glucose, in reaction catalyzed by UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDP-glucose by the enzyme glycogen synthase, which progressively lengthens the glycogen chain with (a1->4) bonded glucose. As glycogen synthase can only lengthen an existing chain, the protein glycogenin is needed to initiate the synthesis of glycogen. The glycogen-branching enzyme, amylo (a1->4) to (a1->6) transglycosylase, catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of 6-7 glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.'''Glycogen degradation''' consists of three steps: (1) the release of glucose 1-phosphate from glycogen, (2) the remodeling of the glycogen substrate to permit further degradation, and (3) the conversion of glucose 1-phosphate into glucose 6-phosphate for further metabolism.Information partly derived from ""Biochemistry"" by Stryer and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen Wikipedia].Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP500 CPTAC Assay Portal]"		9606

Following cell-to-cell propagation within an established infection or reinfection of a previously infected host, the IgG produced by the host covers the surface of Leishmania amastigote parasites, making them more susceptible to phagocytosis through FCGRs (Polando et al. 2013).<br><br>Classically, phagocytosis via FCGRs has been associated with the subsequent activation of Rac GTPases and Cdc42 which in turn activate the phagocyte's NADPH oxidase, contributing to the activation of killing mechanisms (Ueno et al. 2012).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5001	Transcriptional regulation of granulopoiesis		"Neutrophilic granulocytes (hereafter called granulocytes) are distinguished by multilobulated nuclei and presence of cytoplasmic granules containing antipathogenic proteins (reviewed in Cowland and Borregaard 2016, Yin and Heit 2018). Granulocytes comprise eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, and neutrophils, all of which are ultimately derived from hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs), a self-renewing population of stem cells located in the bone marrow. A portion of HSCs exit self-renewing proliferation and differentiate to form multipotent progenitors (MPPs). MPPs then differentiate to form common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) as well as the erythrocyte lineage. CMPs further differentiate into granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) which can then differentiate into monocytes or any of the types of granulocytes (reviewed in Fiedler and Brunner 2012). granulocytes are the most abundant leukocytes in peripheral blood.<br>For early granulopoiesis the CEBPA, SPI1 (PU.1), RAR, CBF, and MYB transcription factors are essential. CEBPE, SPI1, SP1, CDP, and HOXA10 transcription factors initiate terminal neutrophil differentiation.<br>Initially, RUNX1 activates SPI1 (PU.1), which is believed to be the key transcription factor driving the formation of MPPs and CMPs (reviewed in Friedman 2007, Fiedler and Brunner 2012). SPI1, in turn, activates expression of CEBPA, an indispensable transcription factor for granulopoiesis especially important in the transition from CMP to GMP (inferred from mouse homologs in Wilson et al. 2010, Guo et al. 2012, Guo et al. 2014, Cooper et al. 2015). CEBPA, in turn, activates the expression of several transcription factors and receptors characteristic of granulocytes, including CEBPA (autoregulation), CEBPE (Loke et al. 2018, and inferred from mouse homologs in Wang and Friedman 2002, Friedman et al. 2003), GFI1 (inferred from mouse homologs in Lidonnici et al. 2010), KLF5 (Federzoni et al. 2014), IL6R (inferred from mouse homologs in Zhang et al. 1998), and CSF3R (Smith et al. 1996). Importantly, CEBPA dimers repress transcription of MYC (c-Myc) (Johansen et al. 2001, and inferred from mouse homologs in Slomiany et al. 2000, Porse et al. 2001). CEBPA binds CDK2 and CDK4 (Wang et al. 2001) which inhibits their kinase activity by disrupting their association with cyclins thereby limiting proliferation and favoring differentiation of granulocyte progenitors during regular (""steady-state"") granulopoiesis (reviewed in Friedman 2015). The transcription factor GFI1 regulates G-CSF signaling and neutrophil development through the Ras activator RasGRP1 (de la Luz Sierra et al. 2010).<br>Inhibitors of DNA binding (ID) proteins ID1 and ID2 regulate granulopoiesis and eosinophil production such that ID1 induces neutrophil development and inhibits eosinophil differentiation, whereas ID2 induces both eosinophil and neutrophil development (Buitenhuis et al. 2005, Skokowa et al. 2009).<br>Major infection activates emergency granulopoiesis (reviewed in Manz and Boettcher 2014, Hirai et al. 2015), the production of large numbers of granulocytes in a relatively short period of time. Emergency granulopoiesis is activated by cytokines, CSF2 (GM-CSF) and especially CSF3 (G-CSF, reviewed in Panopoulos and Watowich 2008, Liongue et al. 2009) which bind receptors, CSF2R and CSF3R, respectively, resulting in expression of CEBPB, which interferes with repression of MYC by CEBPA (inferred from mouse homologs in Zhang et al. 2010) and represses MYC less than CEBPA does (Hirai et al. 2006), leading to proliferation of granulocyte progenitors prior to final differentiation.Both, emergency and steady-state granulopoiesis are regulated by direct interaction of CEBPA (steady-state) or CEBPB (emergency) proteins with NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases, SIRT1 and SIRT2 (Skokowa et al. 2009). G-CSF induces the NAD+-generating enzyme, Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT, or PBEF), that in turn activates sirtuins (Skokowa et al. 2009).<br>GADD45A and GADD45B proteins are essential for stress-induced granulopoiesis and granulocyte chemotaxis by activation of p38 kinase (Gupta et al. 2006, Salerno et al. 2012). SHP2 is required for induction of CEBPA expression and granulopoiesis in response to CSF3 (G-CSF) or other cytokines independent of SHP2-mediated ERK activation (Zhang et al. 2011).<br>Transcription of neutrophil granule proteins (e.g. ELANE, MPO, AZU1, DEFA4), that play an essential role in bacterial killing are regulated by CEBPE and SPI1 (PU.1) transcription factors (Gombart et al. 2003, Nakajima et al. 2006). RUNX1 and LEF1 also regulate ELANE (ELA2) mRNA expression by binding to its promoter (Li et al. 2003).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5004	Lysine catabolism		In humans, most catabolism of L-lysine normally proceeds via a sequence of seven reactions which feeds into the pathway for fatty acid catabolism. In the first two reactions, catalyzed by a single enzyme complex, lysine is combined with alpha-ketoglutarate to form saccharopine, which in turn is cleaved and oxidized to yield glutamate and alpha-ketoadipic semialdehyde. The latter molecule is further oxidized to alpha-ketoadipate. Alpha-ketoadipate is oxidatively decarboxylated by the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (the same enzyme complex responsible for the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA in the citric acid cycle), yielding glutaryl-CoA. Glutaryl-CoA is converted to crotonyl-CoA, crotonyl-CoA is converted to beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, and beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA is converted to acetoacetyl-CoA. The products of lysine catabolism are thus exclusively ketogenic; i.e., under starvation conditions they can be used for the synthesis of ketone bodies, beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, but not for the net synthesis of glucose (Cox 2001; Goodman and Freeman 2001).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5005	WNT5:FZD7-mediated leishmania damping		Wnt-5a (WNT5) is known for being a highly specific regulated gene in response to microbial infection (Blumenthal et al. 2006, Pereira et al. 2008 & Ljungberg et al. 2019) including leishmaniasis (Chakraborty et al. 2017), where it seems to be involve in mechanisms that dampen the parasite load within main host macrophages (Chakraborty et al. 2017). In addition, WNT5 is a highly responsive gene in human macrophages present in chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (Sen et al. 2000), cancer (Pukrop et al. 2006), atherosclerosis (Christman et al. 2008) and obesity (Ouchi et al. 2010 & Ljungberg et al. 2019).<br><br>Frizzled-7 (FZD7) acts as a receptor of WNT5 which, upon binding, is implicated in the initiation of the non-canonical WNT pathway that ends up in the re-accommodation of the cytoskeleton to allow a process called planar cell polarity (PCP) (Ljungberg et al. 2019). The activation of the WNT5:FZD7 non-canonical signalling cascade that drives PCP is being studied for its involvement in inflammatory responses (Shao et al. 2016). Treatment of RAW264.7 macrophages with recombinant Wnt5a induced NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS production, which has been suggested to contribute to the macrophage control of L. donovani. Consequently, detailed understanding of how WNT signaling network defines host responses to infection could be important to identify potential targets (Ljungberg et al. 2019).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5007	Assembly and cell surface presentation of NMDA receptors		N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are tetramers that consist of two GluN1 (GRIN1) subunits and two subunits that belong to either the GluN2 (GRIN2) subfamily (GluN2A, GluN2B, GluN2C and GluN2D) or the GluN3 (GRIN3) subfamily (GluN3A and GluN3B). The GluN2/GluN3 subunits in the NMDA tetramer can either be identical, constituting an NMDA di-heteromer (di-heterotetramer), which consists of two subunit types, GluN1 and one of GluN2s/GluN3s, or they can be two different GluN2/GluN3 proteins, constituting an NMDA tri-heteromer (tri-heterotetramer), which consists of three subunit types, GluN1 and two of GluN2s/GluN3s (Monyer et al. 1992, Wafford et al. 1993, Sheng et al. 1994, Dunah et al. 1998, Perez-Otano et al. 2001, Chatterton et al. 2002, Matsuda et al. 2002, Yamakura et al. 2005, Nilsson et al. 2007, Hansen et al. 2014, Kaiser et al. 2018, Bhattacharya et al. 2018, Bhattacharya and Traynelis 2018).<br>NMDA tetramers assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum and traffic to the plasma membrane as part of transport vesicles (McIlhinney et al. 1998, Perez-Otano et al. 2001). NMDA receptor subunits undergo N-glycosylation, which impacts their trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. Trafficking efficiency may vary among different subunits of NMDARs (Lichnereva et al. 2015). Mechanistic details, such as glycosyl transferases involved and the type of sugar side chains added, are not known.<br>As there are eight splicing isoforms of GluN1, four different GluN2 and two different GluN3 proteins, many different combinations of NMDAR subunits are possible, but only a handful of distinct NMDAR receptors have been experimentally confirmed and functionally studied. The composition of NMDARs affects trafficking, spatial (including synaptic) localization, ligand preference, channel conductivity and downstream signal transmission. Prevalent NMDARs differ at different stages of neuronal development, in different regions of the central nervous system, and at different levels of neuronal activity.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5010	SUMO E3 ligases SUMOylate target proteins		SUMO proteins are conjugated to lysine residues of target proteins via an isopeptide bond with the C-terminal glycine of SUMO (reviewed in Zhao 2007, Gareau and Lima 2010, Hannoun et al. 2010, Citro and Chiocca 2013, Yang and Chiang 2013). Proteomic analyses indicate that SUMO is conjugated to hundreds of proteins and most targets of SUMOylation are nuclear (Vertegal et al. 2006, Bruderer et al. 2011, Tatham et al. 2011, Da Silva et al. 2012, Becker et al. 2013). Within the nucleus SUMOylation targets include transcription factors (TFs), transcription cofactors (TCs), intracellular (nuclear) receptors, RNA binding proteins, RNA splicing proteins, polyadenylation proteins, chromatin organization proteins, DNA replication proteins, DNA methylation proteins, DNA damage response and repair proteins, immune response proteins, SUMOylation proteins, and ubiquitinylation proteins. Mitochondrial fission proteins are SUMOylated at the mitochondrial outer membrane.<br>UBE2I (UBC9), the E2 activating enzyme of the SUMO pathway, is itself also a SUMO E3 ligase. Most SUMOylation reactions will proceed with only the substrate protein and the UBE2I:SUMO thioester conjugate. The rates of some reactions are further enhanced by the action of other E3 ligases such as RANBP2. These E3 ligases catalyze SUMO transfer to substrate by one of two basic mechanisms: they interact with both the substrate and UBE2I:SUMO thus bringing them into proximity or they enhance the release of SUMO from UBE2I to the substrate.<br>In the cell SUMO1 is mainly concentrated at the nuclear membrane and in nuclear bodies. Most SUMO1 is conjugated to RANGAP1 near the nuclear pore. SUMO2 is at least partially cytosolic and SUMO3 is located mainly in nuclear bodies. Most SUMO2 and SUMO3 is unconjugated in unstressed cells and becomes conjugated to target proteins in response to stress (Golebiowski et al. 2009). Especially notable is the requirement for recruitment of SUMO to sites of DNA damage where conjugation to targets seems to coordinate the repair process (Flotho and Melchior 2013).<br>Several effects of SUMOylation have been described: steric interference with protein-protein interactions, interference with other post-translational modifications such as ubiquitinylation and phosphorylation, and recruitment of proteins that possess a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) (reviewed in Zhao 2007, Flotho and Melchior 2013, Jentsch and Psakhye 2013, Yang and Chiang 2013). In most cases SUMOylation inhibits the activity of the target protein.<br>The SUMOylation reactions included in this module have met two criteria: They have been verified by assays of individual proteins (as opposed to mass proteomic assays) and the effect of SUMOylation on the function of the target protein has been tested.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5011	EGR2 and SOX10-mediated initiation of Schwann cell myelination		Schwann cells are glial cells of the peripheral nervous system that ensheath the peripheral nerves within a compacted lipid-rich myelin structure that is required for optimal transduction of nerve signals in motor and sensory nerves. Schwann cells develop from the neural crest in a differentiation process driven by factors derived from the Schwann cell itself, from the adjacent neuron or from the extracellular matrix (reviewed in Jessen and Mirsky, 2005). Upon peripheral nerve injury, mature Schwann cells can form repair cells that allow peripheral nerve regeneration through myelin phagocytosis and remyelination of the peripheral nerve. This process in some ways recapitulates the maturation of immature Schwann cells during development (reviewed in Jessen and Mirsky, 2016).  Mature, fully myelinated Schwann cells exhibit longitudinal and radial polarization. The axon-distal abaxonal membrane interacts with elements of the basal lamina through integrins and lamins and in this way resembles the basolateral domain of polarized epithelial cells. In contrast, the axon-proximal adaxonal membrane resembles the apical domain of an epithelial cell, and is enriched with adhesion molecules and receptors that mediate interaction with ligands from the axon (reviewed in Salzer, 2015).<br>Schwann cells express a number of Schwann-cell specific proteins, including components of the myelin sheath such as myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin protein zero (MPZ). In addition, Schwann cells have high lipid content relative to other membranes, and are enriched in galactosphingolipids, cholesterol and saturated long chain fatty acids (reviewed in Garbay et al, 2000). This protein and lipid profile is driven by a Schwann cell myelination transcriptional program controlled by master regulators SOX10, POU3F1 and EGR2, among others (reviewed in Svaren and Meijer, 2008; Stolt and Wegner, 2016).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5012	NR1H2 and NR1H3-mediated signaling		The liver X receptors LXRÎ± (NR1H3) and LXRÎ² (NR1H2) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and function as ligand-activated transcription factors. The natural ligands of NR1H2 and NR1H3 are oxysterols (e.g., 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (OH), 25-OH, and 27-OH) that are produced endogenously by enzymatic reactions, by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent oxidation of cholesterol and by the alimentary processes (reviewed in:Jakobsson T et al. 2012; Huang C 2014; Komati R et al. 2017). It has been shown that these oxysterols bind directly to the ligand-binding domain of LXRs with Kd values ranging from 0.1 to 0.4â€ŠmicroM. 24(S), 25-epoxycholesterol was found to be the most potent endogenous agonist (Janowski BA et al. 1999). NR1H3 (LXRÎ±) and NR1H2 (LXRÎ²) showed similar affinities for these compounds (Janowski BA et al. 1999). In physiological conditions, oxysterols are formed in amounts proportional to cholesterol content in the cell and therefore the LXRs operate as cholesterol sensors to alter gene expression and protect the cells from cholesterol overload via: (1) inhibiting intestinal cholesterol absorption; (2) stimulating cholesterol efflux from cells to high-density lipoproteins through the ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1: (3) activating the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in the liver; and (4) activating biliary cholesterol and bile acid excretion (reviewed in: WÃ³jcicka G et al. 2007; Baranowski M 2008; Laurencikiene J & RydÃ©n M 2012; Edwards PA et al. 2002; Zelcer N & Tontonoz P 2006; Zhao C & Dahlman-Wright K 2010). In addition, LXR agonists enhance de novo fatty acid synthesis by stimulating the expression of a lipogenic transcription factor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), leading to the elevation of plasma triglycerides and hepatic steatosis (WÃ³jcicka G et al. 2007; Baranowski M 2008; Laurencikiene J & RydÃ©n M 2012). In addition to their function in lipid metabolism, NR1H2,3 have also been found to modulate immune and inflammatory responses in macrophages (Zelcer N & Tontonoz P 2006). The NR1H2 and NR1H3 molecules can be viewed as having four functional domains: (1) an amino-terminal ligand-independent activation function domain (AF-1), which may stimulate transcription in the absence of ligand; (2) a DNA-binding domain (DBD) containing two zinc fingers; (3) a hydrophobic ligand-binding domain (LBD) required for ligand binding and receptor dimerization; and, (4) a carboxy-terminal ligand-dependent transactivation sequence (also referred to as the activation function-2 (AF-2) domain) that stimulates transcription in response to ligand binding (Robinson-Rechavi M et al. 2003; Jakobsson T et al. 2012; FÃ¤rnegardh M et al. 2003; Lin CY & Gustafsson JA 2015). Although both NR1H3 and NR1H2 are activated by the same ligands and are structurally similar, their tissue expression profiles are very different. NR1H3 is selectively expressed in specific tissues and cell types, such as the liver, intestine, adrenal gland, adipose tissue and macrophages, whereas NR1H2 is ubiquitously expressed (Nishimura M et al. 2004; Bookout AL et al. 2006). Upon activation NR1H2 or NR1H3 heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptors (RXR) and binds to LXR-response elements (LXREs) consisting of a direct repeat of the core sequence 5'-AGGTCA-3' separated by 4 nucleotides (DR4) in the DNA of target genes (Wiebel FF & Gustafsson JA 1997). An inverted repeat of the same consensus sequence with no spacer region(IR-0) and an inverted repeat of the same consensus sequence separated by a 1 bp spacer (IR-1) have also been shown to mediate LXR transactivation (Mak PA et al. 2002, Landrier JF et al. 2003). NR1H3 and NR1H2 have been shown to regulate gene expression via LXREs in the promoter regions of their target genes such as UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A3 (UGT1A3) (Verreault M et al. 2006), fatty acid synthase (FAS) (Joseph SB et al. 2002a), carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP, also known as MLX-interacting protein-like or MLXIPL) (Cha JY & Repa JJ 2007) and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) (Mak PA et al. 2002). LXREs have also been reported to be present in introns of target genes such as the ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) (Sabol SL et al. 2005). NR1H3 has been shown to activate gene expression via the FXR-responsive element found in the proximal promoter of the human ileal bile acid-binding protein (FABP6) (Landrier JF et al. 2003). The NR1H2,3:RXR heterodimers are permissive, in that they can be activated by ligands for either NR1H2,3 (LXR) or RXR (Willy PJ et al. 1995).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5013	Insertion of tail-anchored proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane		"Tail-anchored (TA) proteins have a hydrophobic transmembrane domain (TMD) located near the C-terminus (""tail"") of the protein. Depending on the nature of the TMD, TA proteins can be inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane by at least 4 mechanisms: cotranslational insertion by the signal recognition particle (SRP), post-translational insertion by ASNA1 (TRC40), post-translational insertion by the SRP, and post-translational insertion by a SRP-independent mechanism (SND) (Casson et al. 2017, reviewed in Borgese and Fasana 2011, Casson et al. 2016, Aviram et al. 2016, Chio et al. 2017). Much of the information about the mammalian system of insertion by ASNA1 (TRC40) has been inferred from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue Get3.<br> Prior to post-translational insertion by ASNA1, SGTA binds the transmembrane domain of the substrate TA protein immediately after translation (Leznicki et al. 2011, Leznicki and High 2012, Xu et al. 2012, Wunderly et al. 2014, Shao et al. 2017), the SGTA:TA protein complex then binds the BAG6 complex (BAG6:GET4:UBL4A) via UBL4A (Winnefeld et al. 2006, Chartron et al. 2012, Xu et al. 2012, Leznicki et al. 2013, Mock et al. 2015, Kuwabara et al. 2015, Shao et al. 2017), and the TA protein is transferred to ASNA1 (Mariappan et al. 2010, Leznicki et al. 2011, Shao et al. 2017), also bound by the BAG6 complex via UBL4A. The ASNA1:TA protein complex then docks at the WRB:CAMLG (WRB:CAML) complex located in the ER membrane and the TA protein is inserted into the ER membrane by an uncharacterized mechanism that involves ATP and the transmembrane domain insertase activity of the WRB:CAML complex (Vilardi et al. 2011, Vilardi et al. 2014, Vogl et al. 2016, and inferred from yeast in Wang et al. 2014).<br>Misfolded TA proteins, overexpressed TA proteins, and membrane proteins mislocalized in the cytosol bind SGTA but are not efficiently transferred to ASNA1 and, instead, are retained by BAG6 which recruits RNF126 to ubiquitinate them, targeting them for degradation by the proteasome (Wang et al. 2011, Leznicki and High 2012, Xu et al. 2012, Rodrigo-Brenni et al. 2014, Wunderly et al. 2014, Shao et al. 2017, reviewed in Lee and Ye 2013, Casson et al. 2016, Krysztofinska et al. 2016, Guna and Hegde 2018).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5014	Human cytomegalovirus infection		Herpesviruses have a unique four-layered structure: a core containing the large, double-stranded DNA genome is enclosed by an icosapentahedral capsid which is composed of capsomers. The capsid is surrounded by an amorphous protein coat called the tegument. It is encased in a glycoprotein-bearing lipid bilayer envelope.<br>Herpesviruses are divided into three groups: alpha-herpesviruses, beta-herpesviruses, and gamma-herpesviruses. The beta herpesviruses have a restricted host range. Their reproductive life cycle is long (days), with infection progressing slowly in cell culture systems. These viruses cause their host cells to enlarge, as exemplified by a human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. These viruses can establish latent infection in secretory glands, cells of the reticuloendothelial system, and the kidneys.<br>Human Cytomegalovirus, or HCMV, is a common virus that infects people of all ages. In the United States, nearly one in three children are already infected with HCMV by age 5 years. Over half of adults by age 40 have been infected with HCMV. Once HCMV is in a personâ€™s body, it stays there for life and can reactivate.<br>Cytomegalovirus causes three clinical syndromes:<br>(1) Congenital cytomegalovirus infection (when symptomatic) causes hepatosplenomegaly, retinitis, rash, and central nervous system involvement.<br>(2) In about 10 per cent of older children and adults, primary cytomegalovirus infection causes a mononucleosis syndrome with fever, malaise, atypical lymphocytosis, and pharyngitis.<br>(3) Immunocompromised hosts (transplant recipients and human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]-infected individuals) may develop life-threatening disseminated disease involving the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, liver, retina, and central nervous system.<br>Experimentally HCMV can be propagated in multiple cell lines. When propagated in human fibroblasts, HCMV clinical isolates acquire mutations in a manner that suggests a process of adaptation. Two strains of HCMV AD169 (grown from cultures of adenoid tissue taken from a 7-year-old girl) and Towne (developed as an attenuated vaccine by passaging 125 times in vitro) were initially used as the primary clinical strains. As only 26 % of HCMV canonical genes (45/171) are essential for viral replication in vitro it became important that a model strain be developed.<br>The Merlin BAC was derived for this use. Produced using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) cloning system (to avoid adaptation/degradation of the genome with each passage) the Merlin strain contains a complete HCMV genome that is thought to accurately to represent the original clinical agent from which it was derived. It is also a reproducible source of clonal virus (via transfection) and is capable of reconstituting phenotypically wild-type virus.<br><br>The lifecycle represented here uses the Merlin strain where possible.Infectious Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) particles enter the cell through interaction with cellular receptors. Once in the cytoplasm capsid and tegument proteins are delivered to the cytosol. The capsid travels to the nucleus, where the genome is delivered and circularized. Tegument proteins regulate host cell responses and initiate the expression of viral I immediate early genes. This is followed by delayed early genes, which initiate viral genome replication, then late genes. Late gene expression initiates capsid assembly in the nucleus, followed by nuclear egress to the cytosol. Capsids associate with tegument proteins in the cytosol and are trafficked to the viral assembly complex that contains components from the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and endosomal machinery. The capsids acquire additional tegument proteins and a viral envelope by budding into intracellular vesicles. These vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane to release enveloped infectious particles along with non-infectious dense bodies.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5015	Amino acids regulate mTORC1		The mTORC1 complex acts as an integrator that regulates translation, lipid synthesis, autophagy, and cell growth in response to multiple inputs, notably glucose, oxygen, amino acids, and growth factors such as insulin (reviewed in Sabatini 2017, Meng et al. 2018, Kim and Guan 2019).<br>MTOR, the kinase subunit of mTORC1, is activated by interaction with RHEB:GTP at the cytosolic face of lysosomal membrane (Long et al. 2005, Tee et al. 2005, Long et al. 2007, Yang et al. 2017). Recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane is intricate and incompletely understood. At the center of the system is a complex of two small GTPases, the Rag heterodimer (RRAGA or RRAGB bound to RRAGC or RRAGD). The Rag heterodimer is tethered to the membrane by the Ragulator complex, which also binds the v-ATPase complex. The Rag heterodimer acts as a cross-regulating switch, with the binding of GTP by one subunit inhibiting the exchange of GDP for GTP by the other subunit (Shen et al. 2017). The active conformation of the Rag heterodimer that recruits mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane is RRAGA,B:GTP:RRAGC,D:GDP while the inactive conformation, RRAGA,B:GDP:RRAGC,D:GTP, releases mTORC1 (Sancak et al. 2008, Kim et al. 2008, Sancak et al. 2010, Lawrence et al. 2018). GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) and guanyl nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) acting upon the Rag heterodimer thereby regulate recruitment of mTORC1. RHEB:GTP at the lysosomal membrane also binds mTORC1 and directly activates mTORC1. During inactivation of mTORC1 in response to removal of amino acids, the TSC complex, a GAP for RHEB, is required in addition to the inactive Rag complex to release mTORC1 from RHEB and hence fully release mTORC1 from the lysosomal membrane (Demetriades et al. 2014).<br>Amino acids regulate recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane by at least 4 mechanisms (reviewed in Zhuang et al. 2019, Wolfson and Sabatini 2017, Yao et al. 2017). 1) Sestrin1 (SESN1) or Sestrin2 (SESN2) binds leucine and the Sestrin1,2:leucine complex is then released from the GATOR2 complex, allowing GATOR2 to positively regulate mTORC1 activation (Chantranupong et al. 2014, Parmigiani et al. 2014, Kim et al. 2015, Wolfson et al. 2016, Saxton et al. 2016). 2) CASTOR1 in a homodimer or a heterodimer with CASTOR2 binds arginine and the CASTOR1:arginine complex is likewise released from GATOR2, allowing GATOR2 to activate mTORC1 (Chantranupong et al. 2016, Saxton et al. 2016, Gai et al. 2016, Xia et al. 2016). 3) BMT2 (SAMTOR), a negative regulator of mTORC1 activation, binds S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a derivative of methionine (Gu et al. 2017). The binding of SAM causes BMT2 to dissociate from GATOR1, allowing the activation of mTORC1. 4) The amino acid transporter SLC38A9 binds arginine and SLC38A9 then acts as a GEF to convert RRAGA,B:GDP to the active form, RRAGA,B:GTP (Rebsamen et al. 2015, Wang et al. 2015, Wyant et al. 2017, Shen and Sabatini 2018). Amino acid starvation also regulates the assembly of the V0 and V1 subunits of v-ATPase by an uncharacterized mechanism (Stransky and Forgac 2015) and v-ATPase is required for activation of mTORC1 by amino acids (Zoncu et al. 2011). Glutamine activates mTORC1 by a mechanism that is independent of the Rag GTPases, requires ARF1, but is not yet fully elucidated (Jewell et al. 2015).

Upon FLT3 ligand (FL) binding, the receptor forms dimers and is phosphorylated.

The molecular events involved in viral infection and the response of the human host to it have since been studied in detail and are annotated here (de Wit et al. 2016; Marra et al. 2003). The SARS-CoV-1 viral infection pathway here uses entries listed in the UniProt ""Human SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus)"" taxonomy.<br><br>SARS-CoV-1 infection begins with the binding of viral S (spike) protein to cell surface angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and endocytosis of the bound virion. Within the endocytic vesicle, host proteases mediate cleavage of S protein into S1 and S2 fragments, leading to S2-mediated fusion of the viral and host endosome membranes and release of the viral capsid into the host cell cytosol. The capsid is uncoated to free the viral genomic RNA, whose cap-dependent translation produces polyprotein pp1a and, by means of a 1-base frameshift, polyprotein pp1ab. Autoproteolytic cleavage of pp1a and pp1ab generates 15 or 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) with various functions. Importantly, the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity is encoded in nsp12.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5022	RIPK1-mediated regulated necrosis		Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-kinase protein 1 (RIPK1) and RIPK3-dependent necrosis is called necroptosis or programmed necrosis. The kinase activities of RIPK1 and RIPK3 are essential for the necroptotic cell death in human, mouse cell lines and genetic mice models (Cho YS et al. 2009; He S et al. 2009, 2011; Zhang DW et al. 2009; McQuade T et al. 2013; Newton et al. 2014). The initiation of necroptosis can be stimulated by the same death ligands that activate extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, Fas ligand (FasL), and TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) or toll like receptors 3 and 4 ligands (Holler N et al. 2000; He S et al. 2009; Feoktistova M et al. 2011; Voigt S et al. 2014). In contrast to apoptosis, necroptosis represents a form of cell death that is optimally induced when caspases are inhibited (Holler N et al. 2000; Hopkins-Donaldson S et al. 2000; Sawai H 2014). Specific inhibitors of caspase-independent necrosis, necrostatins, have recently been identified (Degterev A et al. 2005, 2008). Necrostatins have been shown to inhibit the kinase activity of RIPK1 (Degterev A et al. 2008). Importantly, cell death of apoptotic morphology can be shifted to a necrotic phenotype when caspase 8 activity is compromised, otherwise active caspase 8 blocks necroptosis by the proteolytic cleavage of RIPK1 and RIPK3 (Kalai M et al. 2002; Degterev A et al. 2008; Lin Y et al. 1999; Feng S et al. 2007). When caspase activity is inhibited under certain pathophysiological conditions or by pharmacological agents, deubiquitinated RIPK1 is engaged in physical and functional interactions with the cognate kinase RIPK3 leading to formation of necrosome, a necroptosis-inducing complex consisting of RIPK1 and RIPK3 (Sawai H 2013; Moquin DM et al. 2013; Kalai M et al. 2002; Cho YS et al. 2009, He S et al. 2009, Zhang DW et al. 2009). Within the necrosome RIPK1 and RIPK3 bind to each other through their RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) domains. The RHIMs can facilitate RIPK1:RIPK3 oligomerization, allowing them to form amyloid-like fibrillar structures (Li J et al. 2012; Mompean M et al. 2018). RIPK3 in turn interacts with mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) (Sun L et al. 2012; Zhao J et al. 2012; Murphy JM et al. 2013; Chen W et al. 2013). The precise mechanism of MLKL activation by RIPK3 is incompletely understood and may vary across species (Davies KA et al. 2020). Mouse MLKL activation relies on transient engagement of RIPK3 to facilitate phosphorylation of the pseudokinase domain (Murphy JM et al. 2013; Petrie EJ et al. 2019a), while it appears that stable recruitment of human MLKL by necrosomal RIPK3 is an additional crucial step in human MLKL activation (Davies KA et al. 2018; Petrie EJ et al. 2018, 2019b). RIPK3-mediated phosphorylation is thought to initiate MLKL oligomerization, membrane translocation and membrane disruption (Sun L et al. 2012; Wang H et al. 2014; Petrie EJ et al. 2020; Samson AL et al. 2020). Studies in human cell lines suggest that upon induction of necroptosis MLKL shifts to the plasma membrane and membranous organelles such as mitochondria, lysosome, endosome and ER (Wang H et al. 2014), but it is trafficking via a Golgi-microtubule-actin-dependent mechanism that facilitates plasma membrane translocation, where membrane disruption causes death (Samson AL et al. 2020). The mechanisms of necroptosis regulation and execution downstream of MLKL remain elusive. The precise oligomeric form of MLKL that mediates plasma membrane disruption has been highly debated (Cai Z et al. 2014; Chen X et al. 2014; Dondelinger Y et al. 2014; Wang H et al. 2014; Petrie EJ et al. 2017, 2018; Samson AL et al. 2020 ). However, microscopy data revealed that MLKL assembles into higher molecular weight species upon cytoplasmic necrosomes within human cells, and upon phosphorylation by RIPK3, MLKL is trafficked to the plasma membrane (Samson AL et al. 2020). At the plasma membrane, phospho-MLKL forms heterogeneous higher order assemblies, which are thought to permeabilize cells, leading to release of DAMPs to invoke inflammatory responses. While RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL are the core signaling components in the necroptosis pathway, many additional molecules have been proposed to positively and negatively tune the signaling pathway. Currently, this picture is evolving rapidly as new modulators continue to be discovered.<p>The Reactome module describes MLKL-mediated necroptotic events on the plasma membrane.

Besides ""classical"" NKH, there are several patients without mutations in the cleavage enzyme, however presenting variants within a protein related to the formation of lipoyl-H, as depicted on the righthand side of this pathway. The individual relationship between these proteins and the formation of iron-sulfur clusters (Fe-S) are not completely known, however there are indications that mutations within the NFU1, BOLA3 and GLXR5 gene can lead to a similar phenotype as NKH; most patients present with either less or more severe neurological symptoms compared to ""classical"" NKH.

Four carboxylase groups (ACC, MCC, PCC and PC) are activated by binding to biotin and forming holocarboxylases, which in turn are responsible for several metabolic conversion in the Fatty Acid Synthesis, Leucine catabolism, propanoate metabolism and gluconeogenesis. Except for the ACC conversion from acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA starting the fatty acid synthesis, all other three interactions are connected to disorders. Furthermore, one can distinguish two ""multiple carboxylase defects"" (MCDs), which are connected to the conversion of biocytin into biotin (BTD), or unbound biotin to one of the apocarboxylases (HCSD).This pathway was inspired by Chapter 14 (edition 4) of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361))."		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5035	ACE2 inhibition leads to pulmonary fibrosis		This AOP outlines how ACE-2 plays a detrimental role in causing fibrotic damage to the lung by influencing various factors such as fibrogenic components, proinflammatory cytokines, and a lack of oxygen. When the activity of ACE2 is suppressed, the conversion of Ang II into Ang-(1-7) is not properly facilitated. Consequently, the levels of proinflammatory Ang II rise, while the levels of anti-inflammatory Ang-(1-7) decrease. Notably, ACE2 inhibition has been observed to raise the levels of Ang II peptides, which are a ligand for the type 1 angiotensin receptor (AT1R). This phenomenon is considered a significant risk factor for lung fibrosis, vasoconstriction, endothelial dysfunction, and cell death.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5043	Pentose phosphate pathway in senescent cells		The pentose phosphate pathway is an important route for glucose oxidation. This pathway is divided over 2 different branches; the non-oxidative and the oxidative. The oxidative branch supports the regeneration of reduced NADPH, while converting glucose-6-phosphate into ribulose-5-phosphate and CO2 in an unidirectional way. This branch is also linked to glycolysis at the glucose-6-phosphate level, while the non-oxidative branch is linked to glycolysis in a bidirectional way, depending on the availability of the intermediates glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate. This non-oxidative branch converts pentose phosphates into phosphorylated ketones and aldoses (Almeida et al., 2018). During this process, ribose-5-phosphate is produced, which is an important precursor for nucleotide synthesis. The regeneration of the NADPH by the oxidative branch, is regulated by the NADP+/NADPH ratio. When this ratio is lower, due to lower levels of NADPH, the regeneration of NADPH is stimulated in order to maintain the balance (Clement et al., 2019). In case of senescence, OIS heightens this ratio, while proliferative exhaustion-induced senescence lowers this ratio. Furthermore, p53 lowers glycolysis by lowering the level of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate. The PPP is also upregulated due to oxidative stress and by conditions of low stress induced by P53, which is symptomatic of PE-induced senescence (Zhang et al., 2016).  Another study by Wu et al. (2017) showed that one of the rate-limiting enzymes, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH), is upregulated in OIS, due to which the PPP is also upregulated again.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5044	Kynurenine pathway and links to cell senescence		The kynurenine pathway is the major path for Tryptophan (Trp) breakdown (Castro-Portuguez & Sutphin, 2020; Dalton et al.,2020; Kondrikov et al., 2020; Li, Oxenkrug & Yang, 2017; Lindquist et al., 2020; Lugo-Huitron et al., 2013; Oxenkrug, 2011; Platten et al., 2019; Savitz, 2019; Soegdrageret al., 2019; Tan & Guillemin, 2019). The kynurenine (Kyn)/Trp ratio is proposed to be an accurate indicator of biological age as well as an indicator of risk for age-related diseases (Castro-Portuguez & Sutphin, 2020;  Li et al., 2017; Lindquist et al., 2020; Oxenkrug, 2011; Platten et al., 2019; Savitz, 2019; Soegdrageret al., 2019).  The first and also rate-limiting enzymes that determine rate of Trp conversion into N-formylkynurenine and further on into Kyn are tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), out of which the IDO isoform IDO1 is the most important (Castro-Portuguez & Sutphin, 2020; Dalton et al.,2020;  Li et al., 2017; Lindquist et al., 2020; Lugo-Huitron et al., 2013; Minhas et al., 2018; Oxenkrug, 2011; Platten et al., 2019; Savitz, 2019; Soegdrageret al., 2019; Tan & Guillemin, 2019). This catalytic enzyme is activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins, interferons gamma and beta or the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) (Castro-Portuguez & Sutphin, 2020; Dalton et al.,2020; Kondrikov et al., 2020; Li et al., 2017; Lindquist et al., 2020; Lugo-Huitron et al., 2013; Oxenkrug, 2011; Platten et al., 2019; Savitz, 2019; Soegdrageret al., 2019; Tan & Guillemin, 2019).  Next, N-formylkynurenine is converted either into kynurenic acid by a kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT), anthranilic acid by kynureninase or, into Kyn by formidase (AFMID) (Castro-Portuguez & Sutphin, 2020). Kyn can alter the regulation of cell cycle and proliferation and induce oxidative stress through by inducing the transcription of multiple miRNAs (Dalton et al., 2020),  activating the p53/p21 pathway (Kondrikov et al., 2020) and  binding to AhR, resulting in a positive feedback loop, while further promoting oxidative stress (Castro-Portuguez & Sutphin, Dalton et al., 2020; 2020, Kondrikov et al., 2020).  Kyn is further converted into 3-hydroxykynurenine (3HK) by kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO), then Kynureninase converts 3HK into 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3HAA) and then into 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate-6-semialdehyde (ACMSA) (Castro-Portuguez & Sutphin, 2020, Lindquist et al., 2020; Lugo-Huitron et al., 2013; Platten et al., 2019; Savitz, 2019; Tan & Guillemin, 2019). 3-HK can alternatively be converted into xanthurenic acid, a metabolite that modulates the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) pathway,(Tan & Guillemin, 2019). 3HAA can be converted either into quinolinic acid and from there enter the de novo NAD synthesis due to the enzymatic action of nicotinate-nucleotide pyrophosphorylase (QPRT), or it can be converted into 2-aminomuconate-6-semialdehyde (AMSA) which can be converted into glutaryl-CoA and enter the TCA cycle and glycolysis (Castro-Portuguez & Sutphin, 2020; Lindquist et al., 2020; Lugo-Huitron et al., 2013; Platten et al., 2019; Savitz, 2019; Tan & Guillemin, 2019).		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5046	NAD metabolism in oncogene-induced senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction-associated senescence		The uppermost part of the pathway includes part of the general NAM salvage pathway in the cytosol as it is relevant to senescence-induced changes to NAD metabolism. In this pathway, NAD levels are maintained through recycling back to NAD from nicotinamide (NAM) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) (Braidy et al., 2019). The conversion from NAM to NMN is catalyzed by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), while the conversion from NMN to NAD is catalyzed by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases (NMNATs). Other sources, such as nicotinic acid (NA) and nicotinamid riboside (NR), are not shown here as they are not affected by senescence, at least from current research. OIS-specific interactions are highlighted in orange, while MiDAS-specific interactions are highlighted in purple. General interactions for both (or other senescent types) remain a black color.The OIS pathway, induced by Ras singalling in this case, results in the upregulation of HMGA1, and stimulation of the NAMPT enzyme (Nacarelli et al., 2019). Resulting increased levels of NMN (the direct metabolite of NAMPT) translate to increased NAD levels, and a high NAD-NADH ratio. This leads to decreased ADP-ATP levels, which causes a decreased phosphorylated AMPK expression (Nacarelli et al., 2019). This interaction causes increased p38 and p65 activation, and increased NF-κB activity. The  NF-κB signalling pathway has been known to play a key role in the promotion of the proinflammatory SASP (Freund et al., 2011). Furthermore, this is correlated with increased expression of interleukins IL1B, IL6 and IL8, all key factors in the proinflammatory wave of the SASP. In addition, Nacarelli et al. (2019) found that the proinflammatory environment created as a result of the increased NAD-NADH ratio leads to acceleration of cancer progression. NAMPT upregulation through HMGA1 also resulted in the expression of senescence markers SA-ß-gal, p16 and p21. The resulting phenotype from this high NAD-NADH ratio is a high proinflammatory SASP.  Malate is another important metabolite in redox reactions and in many senescence types, including OIS and MiDAS. Of interest to NAD metabolism is the malate-aspartate shuttle, where NADH is transferred from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix through malate dehydrogenase 1 (MDH1) (Lee et al., 2012). In senescence, levels of MDH1 decrease. On the other hand, decreased activity of MDH1 can induce a senescence response. This reduction in MDH1 activity results in a decreased cytosolic NAD-NADH. Lastly, this inhibition may result in loss of cell proliferation due to the requirement of aspartate synthesis in response to inhibition of the electron transport chain (Birsoy et al., 2015).Mitochondrial dysfunction-associated senescence (MiDAS), on the other hand, causes a decrease in the NAD-NADH ratio, which induces three main responses: (1) the inhibition of sirtuins, (2) the activation of AMPK and (3) the inhibition of PARP which blocks the NF-kB pathway. First, low levels of NAD+ decrease sirtuin activity. A decrease in the activity of SIRT3 and  SIRT5, located in the mitochondria, is associated with the activation of cell senescence (Wiley et al., 2016)). Second, a decreased NAD+/NADH ratio activates AMPK and p53, which inhibits the RNA binding protein Hu antigen R (HuR) from degrading the mRNAs encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21 and p16INK4a. This increases the activity of the pRB tumor suppressor, resulting in cell proliferation and growth arrest ((Wiley et al., 2016)). Additionally, p53 activation leads to the release of SASPs that lack IL-1-dependent factors but include the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines CCL27 and TNF-α (Wiley et al., 2016). The activation of p53 also reduces glycolysis and promotes mitochondrial respiration, by inhibiting phosphoglycercate mutase (PGM) and inducing the expression of synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2 (SCO2). Furthermore, p53 activation inhibits the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) by binding to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). Lastly, the low NAD+,NADH ratio inhibits ADP-ribose donor for poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), which consecutively inhibits the NF-kB pathway. A downregulated NF-κB pathway then contributes to the pathogenic processes of various inflammatory diseases as well as the expression of various proinflammatory SASPs (Liu et al., 2017). As visible in this pathway, when senescence is induced by either OIS or MiDAS distinguishable effects on NAD metabolism are evident. Not only do these stimuli release distinct SASPs, but they exhibit distinct responses on the NAD-NADH ratio and subsequent related pathways. While MiDAS leads to a decrease in the NAD-NADH ratio, OIS causes an increase in this ratio and the NAD+ levels.		9606

RHOBTB2 is involved in COP9 signalosome-regulated and CUL3-dependent protein ubiquitination (Berthold et al. 2008; Ji and Rivero 2016). RHOBTB3 participates in CUL3 dependent protein ubiquitination, vesicle transport, regulation of the cell cycle and modulating the adaptive response to hypoxia (Berthold et al. 2008; Ji and Rivero 2016).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5048	Transcriptional regulation of testis differentiation		In humans, primordial germ cells (PGCs) are specified about 2 weeks after fertilization, a time before gastrulation (reviewed in Svingen and Koopman 2013, MÃ¤kelÃ¤ et al. 2019). PGCs are initially located extraembryonically and then migrate to colonize the gonadal ridges (genital ridges) of the embryo during the fifth week after fertilization. At this time, either ovaries and testes can originate from the gonadal ridges. That is, the cells of the gonadal ridges are initially bipotential and remain bipotential until about 42 days after conception, when transient expression of the SRY gene located on the Y chromosome in male embryos is initiated in some somatic cells of the gonadal primordium (reviewed in Sekido and Lovell-Badge 2013, Barrionuevo et al. 2013, Svingen et al. 2013,  MÃ¤kelÃ¤ et al. 2019).<br>The transcription factors WT1, GATA4, ZFPM2 (FOG2), and the nuclear receptor NR5A1 (SF1) activate transcription of SRY (Shimamura et al. 1997, Hossain and Saunders 2001, De Santa Barbara et al. 2001, Miyamoto et al. 2008, and inferred from mouse homologs). SRY and NR5A1 then activate transcription of SOX9, one of the master regulators of testis development and maintenance (Knower et al. 2011, Croft et al. 2018, inferred from mouse homologs, reviewed in Gonen and Lovell-Badge 2019). Regulation of genes by SRY and then, when expression of SRY decreases, by SOX9 causes the specification of Sertoli cells that further organize formation of the testis by encasing the primordial germ cells in protocords, which then form fully developed testis cords.<br>SOX9 directly activates its own promoter to maintain SOX9 expression through development and into adulthood (Croft et al. 2018, and inferred from mouse homologs). SOX9 and GATA4 directly activate DMRT1 (inferred from mouse homologs), which maintains testis specification by maintaining expression of SOX9 and other testis-related genes. DMRT1 also acts to suppress ovarian specification by binding and repressing FOXL2 and WNT4 genes (inferred from mouse homologs). SOX9 directly activates FGF9 (inferred from mouse homologs), which acts via FGFR2 to maintain SOX9 expression, and PTGDS (inferred from mouse homologs), which converts Prostaglandin H2 to Prostaglandin D2, a critical hormone-like lipid that recruits supporting cells to Sertoli cells and acts indirectly to maintain SOX9 expression. SOX9, NR5A1, and GATA4 directly activate AMH (De Santa Barbara et al. 1998, and inferred from mouse homologs), an extracellular signaling molecule which causes regression of the Muellerian duct of the female reproductive system. SOX9 also directly activates many other genes, including DHH (Rahmoun et al. 2017, and inferred from mouse homologs), an intercellular signaling molecule required for testis formation.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5049	Glycolysis in senescence		Glycolysis appears to be upregulated in most senescent phenotypes. This is hypothesized to match with the increased need for proteins and lipids needed for senescence-associated events such as extracellular secretions (SASP) and cell enlargement (Wiley & Campisi, 2016). It is also supposed to cause an increase in NF-κB signalling and cause inflammatory cascades associated with senescence. Glycolysis is also responsible for increased lactate production by producing pyruvate, along with several other mechanisms including upregulated lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), pyruvate kinase (PKM), serinolysis and glutaminolysis. Pyruvate kinase (PKM) is responsible for the last conversion step of glycolysis, producing pyruvate. The enzyme is upregulated in replicative senescence and leads to increased TCA activity and oxygen consumption rate (Sabbatinelli et al., 2019). Findings were similar in another study on oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) (Dörr et al., 2013). PKM is also thought to increase lactate production indirectly (Zwerschke et al., 2003). In parallel, lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) is also upregulated, which leads to this increase in lactate levels in senescent cells. Senescence induced by oncogenes also has an impact on serinolysis and glutaminolysis. These are processes in which serine and glutamine are consumed to produce energy. They usually take place in tumour cells as an alternative source of energy, and produce lactate (among others) as a by-product. It has been found that both processes are increased in OIS, and lead to increases in lactate levels (Mazurek et al., 2001). Such increased levels of lactate lead to several events associated with senescence, such as tumorigenesis, wound healing and evasion from immune responses (Nacarelli & Sell, 2017). The upregulation of several glycolytic enzymes seems to mediate increased glycolysis in various types of induced senescence. Depending on the stimulus, various proteins and genes influence glycolytic rates. For example, in irradiation-induced senescence, this effect seems to be mediated by AMPK activation and NF-kB signalling (Nacarelli & Sell, 2017). Similarly, in OIS, the retinoblastoma protein appears to upregulate glycolytic genes (Nacarelli & Sell, 2017). The very important p53 is known to be a central mediator of senescence, due to its role in cell cycle regulation. It has been found to negatively affect glycolysis (Gu et al., 2018). However it also has an indirect positive effect on it, by activating G6PDH in stressed cells (Jiang et al., 2011). TP53 is therefore thought to have a regulatory role on glycolysis and is interesting in the context of senescence.While most glycolytic enzymes are upregulated (Zwerschke et al., 2003), GAPDH seems to decrease. This may partially be explained by the sensitivity of the enzyme to oxidative stress.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5050	TCA cycle in senescence		Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a central enzyme in relation to the TCA cycle, as it converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA. Its activity favours TCA cycle activity. PDH is downregulated by PDH kinase (PDK) and upregulated by PDH phosphatase (PDP). PDK and PDP are respectively down and upregulated in OIS, in particular in the case of the oncogene BRAFV600E (James et al., 2015; Wiley & Campisi, 2016). Due to these regulatory mechanisms, PDH is a crucial mediator of OIS for TCA activity.Malic enzyme (ME) is another crucial enzyme in the TCA cycle. There appears to be a reciprocal regulation between p53 and ME, mediated through AMPK activation. Downregulation of ME leads to p53-mediated induction of senescence, while upregulation can suppress it (Jiang et al., 2013; Wiley & Campisi, 2016). Because ME uses NAD+/NADP+ and produces NADH/NADPH, downregulation of the enzyme also affects NADPH-dependent mechanisms, including antioxidant defenses. This in turn can cause accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which activate p53 through AMPK and cause senescence (Wiley & Campisi, 2016).In OIS, accumulation of TCA intermediates has been observed, including alpha-ketoglutarate, citrate and malate (Kaplon et al., 2013). Further research showed that increased alpha-ketoglutarate has an effect on transcriptional regulation (Salama et al., 2014).Lipids are also part of the input of the TCA cycle, and fatty acid oxidation has been observed to increase in OIS (Sabbatinelli et al., 2019).Malate dehydrogenase (MDH1) also plays an important role in the TCA cycle and is part of the malate-aspartate shuttle. Lower levels of the enzyme were observed in DNA-damage induced and proliferative exhaustion-induced senescent cells. Downregulation of MDH1 also affects the NAD+/NADH ratio, known to be related to senescence. Other enzymes of the malate-aspartate shuttle also affect this ratio, such as the aspartate aminotransferase (GOT1).

There are three mechanisms leading to the formation of oxysterols: 1) Enzymatically (first steps of sterol metabolism, being intermediates for the formation of steroid hormones, bile acids and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3); see https://www.wikipathways.org/instance/WP4545, 2) Non-enzymatically by encountering reactive oxygen species (ROS), providing a second pool of metabolites (this pool also includes oxidized cholesterol molecules taken in from diet); described in this pathway, and 3) Generation by the gut microflora and uptake through the enterohepatic circulation. Previously oxysterols where though to be inactive metabolic intermediates, however recent findings have established that these metabolites are involved in cholesterol homoeostasis, can be ligands to nuclear and G protein-coupled receptors and biomarkers of diseases (for example Niemann-Pick disease).This pathway describes Figure 4 and 5 from Griffiths et al. 2020 and was extended with disease information.		9606

Glutamine is generated from blood-derived glucose, transported to pre-synaptic neurons and converted into glutamate. Alternatively, glucose is converted into D-serine, which functions as co-agonist for NMDARs and is broken down by DAAO. CNS inflammation induces M1 and M2 microglia, which modulate neuronal and astrocyte function.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5085	Vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption		This pathway describes Vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption from the kidney tubules of the nephrons back into the circulation. Vasopressin, antidiuretic hormone (ADH), is a peptide hormone produced in neurons of the hypothalamus in response to changes in response to extracellular fluid hypertonicity (hyperosmolality), and is secreted into the circulation. When it reaches the kidney, it binds to Vasopressin 2 receptors, triggering an intracellular signaling cascade that ultimately leads to aquaporin 2 (AQP2) vesicles inserted in the apical membrane. This increases the water permeability of the membrane. An osmotic gradient then drives water transport from the collecting duct through AQP2, and water exits the cell on the basolateral side, and back into the circulation.This description was adapted from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasopressin Wikipedia] and [https://www.genome.jp/entry/pathway+map04962 KEGG].This pathway was modeled from [https://www.genome.jp/entry/pathway+map04962 KEGG].		9606

Through a literature study and community workshop, several pathways have been identified to contribute to the development of the disease, which are captured in this PM pathway. Frequently mutated genes are highlighted in bold, where red nodes indicate tumor suppressor genes, and yellow indicates oncogenes.

Prostaglandins are amongst the many inflammatory mediators that incite a cytokine storm in COVID-19 after Bradykinin receptor B1 (BDKRB1) activation. This pathway mainly focuses on PGE2 and PGI2 and their interactions that lead to hyperinflammation via cytokine storms, immunothrombosis as well as the recruitment of fibrosis-mediating factors (VEGF, TGFB1, AREG). These pathways take place in multiple cell types such as: Monocytes, Macrophages, Fibroblasts, Th17 cells, Nk cells, et cetera.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5090	Complement system in neuronal development and plasticity		The complement system can be activated through the classical, alternative or leptin pathway. Antigen-antibody complexes are recognised by C1q, which causes the sequential cleavages of C1r and C1s (classical pathway). Collectins and ficolins bind to MBL-associated serine proteases (lectin pathway). Activation of the alternative pathway involves spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 and subsequent cleavages by factors B, D and I. All cascades converge into a common pathway producing opsonins (C3b) that target cells for phagocytosis. Upon increasing activation, subcomponents C5b-C9 form the membrane attack complex (MAC), which induces cellular lysis. Smaller anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a and C5a) mediate chemotaxis of immune cells and vasoactivation. Furthermore, complement regulator proteins such as SERPING1, Factor H, CSMD1 and CD59 negatively regulate the cascade. Additionally, C3d/CR2 signaling inhibits adult NPC proliferation (green). Anaphylatoxins and lectin components enhance migration (green). C5a-C5aR1 signaling contributes to NPC polarity and proliferation (blue). Apoptotic signaling, TGFβ, C1q, C3b and CR3 mediate selective synaptic pruning of weak synapses.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5101	Congenital generalized lipodystrophy		Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) is divided into four subtypes. Type 1 is mainly caused by mutations in AGPAT2 gene, subtype 2 by BSCL2 mutations, type  3 by CAV1 mutations and type 4 by CAVIN1 mutations. Patients with CGL show a near total absence of body fat which starts either at birth or shortly after. There are also metabolic abnormalities. Type 1 CGL shows loss of metabolically active adipose tissue. Type 2 CGL has a general absence of adipose tissue. Patients with type 3 CGL show vitamin D resistance, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia and have a short stature. Patients with type 4 CGL show myopathy, skeletal abnormalities, cardiac arrhythmias, pyloric stenosis and gastrointestinal motility problems.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5102	Familial partial lipodystrophy		Familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD) is divided into six subtypes of the disease. It is not known yet which gene is mutated to cause FPLD type 1. Type 2 is caused by mutations in lamin A, which can be either through LMNA mutations or ZMPSTE24 mutations. Type 3 has been shown to be linked to PPARG mutations. The LIPE gene causes triacylglycerol breakdown. Mutations in this gene lead more breakdown and causes type 6 FPLD. CIDEC inhibits LIPE. Mutations in CIDEC lead to type 5 FPLD. PLIN1 stimulates CIDEC and mutations in this leads to type 4 FPLD. The phenotype related to all types of FPLD, is a loss of adipose tissue in the limbs and some metabolic abnormalities. With FPLD type 1 there is a loss of subcutaneous fat from the limbs. Patients with type 2 have an increased muscularity and a loss of fat in the limbs. There is also an accumulation of fat in the face and neck. In type 3 there is a loss of adipose tissue in the distal part of the limbs. Type 4 patients have shown to have small adipocytes, macrophage infiltration and fibrosis of adipose tissue. In type 5, there are small compartments in lipid droplets. Lastly, type 6 FPLD shows an increased visceral fat, hepatosteatosis, insulin resistance, and diabetes. Some patients may show muscular dystrophy and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5103	Progeria-associated lipodystrophy		Progeroid syndromes are a group of diseases that cause premature aging in the affected. In this pathway, the progeroid diseases, which also show lipodystrophy in the affected, are in red and linked to these are the genes that are mutated for these diseases. These genes are specifically linked to lipodystrophy.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5104	Acquired partial lipodystrophy / Barraquer-Simons syndrome		Autoimmune diseases have been shown to cause an increased level of C3NeF, which makes the C3bBb comples more stable. Because of this, there will be continuous stimulation of the alternative pathway, leading to excess amounts of membrane attack complex. These MACs will lead to adipocyte lysis, causing Barraquer-Simons syndrome. Many patients have shown mutations in the LMNB2 gene, but this is not the case for all patients. Some people with mutations in this gene do not have the disease. More evidence is therefore required to conclude if this gene is linked to the disease.Patients with this disease have a decrease of fat in the face, neck, upper extremities, trunk and upper abdomen. Some patients also have excess fat over the gluteal region, thighs and calves.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5105	Meta pathway lipodystrophy, dyslipidemia and hyperlipidemia		Dyslipidemia is a change (either increase or decrease) of adipose levels within the blood. When there is a significant increase of this, the term hyperlipidemia is used. With a significant decrease, we talk about hypolipoproteinemia. Both hyperlipidemia and hypolipoproteinemia can be classified as either acquired or familial. Familial hyperlipidemia can be classified in five types according to the Fredrickson classification.For this classification see Quispe et al. 2019 https://doi.org/10.5114/aoms.2019.87207.Lipodystrophy is a change (either increase or decrease) of adipose levels within the lipid tissue deposits. Lipodystrophy is classified based on wether the disease is acquired or congenital, but also wether it is geralized (through the entire body) or partial (in specific parts of the body). This classification was based on the following information by Akinci et al. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513130/]		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5108	Familial  hyperlipidemia type 1		Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification. Type 1 of this classification is linked to a decrease of LPL, either through mutations on the gene itself or because of other factors. LPL hydrolyzed triglycerides in chylomicrons and in very low-density lipoproteins. Type 1 familial hyperlipidemia shows an increase of chylomicrons. LPL normally hydrolizes these chylomicrons into chylomicron remnants. However, mutations in LPL have been shown to be the cause of the first form of type 1 hyperlipidemia. In tissue, LMF1 causes proper folding and assembly of LPL, which is stabalized by Sel1L. LPL is then transported to the endothelial cell surface of the capillary lumen, where it binds to GPIHBP1. APOC2 is essential for LPL activation, which is stabalized by APOA5. Studies have found another form of LPL activity, but with an increased amount of LPL inhibitors. These inhibitors are ANGPTL3,4 and 8. Which of these are inhibiting LPL depends on the tissue the LPL is in.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5109	Familial hyperlipidemia type 2		Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification. Type II familial hyperlipidemia is divided into 2 subtypes, IIa and IIb. IIa is linked with mutations in the LDL receptor (LDLR) or genes that regulate the LDL uptake. Therefore, we see an increase of LDL with type IIa familial hyperlipidemia. IIa can be subdived into 4 different types. FHCL1 is caused by direct mutations of the LDLR. This FCHL1 has different phenotypes linked to it which are cause by mutations in APOA2, EPHX2 and GHR. FCHL2 is caused by mutations in APOB, which acts as a ligand for the LDLR. FHCL3 is caused by mutations in PCSK9 which binds to LDLR to inhibit LDL uptake. Lastly, FHCL4 is linked with mutations in LDLRAP1, which stimulates receptor binding.Typ IIB familial hyperlipidemia is known as familial combined hyperlipidemia. This type has shown an increase of both LDL and VLDL. Type IIB can be divided into 3 subtypes. FCHL1 is caused by mutations in USF1 which plays a role in cellular transcription. However, it is unclear how exactly this is linked to the lipid metabolism. HYPLIP2 is caused by mutations in APOB, which is linked to the reduced LDL. APOB is also a primmary apolipoprotein for VLDL. Lastly, FCHL3 is linked to LPL mutations, which is mostly linnked to hydrolizing the VLDL into IDL.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5110	Familial hyperlipidemia type 3		Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification. Type III is also known is familial dysbetalipoproteinemia. It is mainly linked to an increase of IDL. This is caused by APOE. APOE has multiple types, and is part of LDL, IDL, VLDL and chylomicrons. APOE also binds to LDLR, which is required for normal catabolism of triglycerid-rich proteins. Specifically APOE2 is linked with to IDL and because of this, mutations in APOE2 will lead to dysbetalipoproteinemia.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5111	Familial hyperlipidemia type 4		Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification. Type IV familial hyperlipidemia is also known as familial hypertriglyceridemia. Typ IV is mostly linked to in increased VLDL within the blood. This is from both an increased production as well as a decreased elimination of VLDL. The increased production is caused by mutations of GCKR. This gene inhibits glucokinase, which would lead to less triglycerides produced in the liver. These triglycerides would then increase the amount of VLDL in the blood. Mutations in GCKR would therefore lead to increased VLDL. A decreased elimination is caused by APOA5. APOA5 plays a role in the hydrolysis of VDLD by LPL. Mutations in this gene would therefore lead to a decrease of this hydrolysis.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5112	Familial hyperlipidemia type 5		Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification. Type V familial hyperlipidemia is also known as combined hyperlipidemia as it look like a combination of type I and type IV. In type V familial hyperlipidemia there is an increase in both chylomicrons and VLDL. Both of the lipoproteins are hydrolyzed by LPL. However, this is mainly caused by mutations in APOA5. APOA5 plays a role in stablizing the APOC2-LPL complex, which is needed to hydrolize VLDL and chylomicrons. Mutations in APOA5 would therefore lead to instability of this complex and less hydrolysis. Some cases have also shown a decrease in LPL itself, which was mostly linked to the VLDL increase.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5114	Nucleotide excision repair in xeroderma pigmentosum 		Nucleotide excision repair is a DNA repair mechanism that repairs DNA damaged by UV radiation. This type of damage produces bulky distortions in the shape of DNA double helix due to the addition of DNA adducts, mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts.Recognition of distortions leads to the removal of a short single-stranded DNA segment that includes the lesion, creating a single-strand gap in the DNA, which is subsequently filled in by DNA polymerase, which uses the undamaged strand as a template. NER can be divided into two subpathways (Global genomic NER and Transcription coupled NER) that differ only in their recognition of helix-distorting DNA damage. Nucleotide excision repair has more complexity in eukaryotes. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a particularly important DNA repair mechanism as evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins including Xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome.This pathway was adapted from [https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+hsa03420 KEGG], [http://repairtoire.genesilico.pl/Pathway/2/ REPAIRtoire] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide_excision_repair Wikipedia].

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5120	Inclusion body myositis		Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a rare muscle degeneration diseases. It is caused by presumably both genetic risk factors and environmental factors stimulated by increasing age. The mechanism of pathogenicity includes inflammation, ER stress/unfolded protein response, and disturbed autophagy, which leads to an accumulation of inclusions. The mechanism is similar to Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease in neurons. This pathway is based on Figure 1 of Askanas V. et al. 2015.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5121	Sphingolipid metabolism in senescence		Sphingolipids, which include sphingomyelins, sphingosines and ceramides are bioactive bioactive molecules present in all eukaryotic cells, are important in regulating various aspects of cell biology, such as cell cycle, proliferation, and even senescence (Trayssac et al., 2018). Evidence shows that ceramide metabolism is deregulated in cellular senescence and can even induce it. (Venable et al., 2006).Ceramides are thought to induce senescence in a p53 dependent and independent manner by hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (Lee et al., 2000; Dix 2018; Jeffries & Krupenko, 2018). Ceramides function both down- and upstream of p53 (Jeffries et al., 2018). p53 mediates the interference of the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma-like protein RBL1 and RBL through the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (Jeffries et & Krupenko, 2018). Additionally, p53 has been demonstrated to directly activate ceramide synthase. (Jeffries & Krupenko, 2018). Consequently, this implies a feedback mechanism between ceramides and the tumor suppressor.  Ceramide also interacts directly with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) by inhibiting it, therefore causing telomere instability (Hannun & Obeid, 2002; Deevska et al., 2021). Ceramides activate protein phosphatase 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A), which increases the levels of p21 (Trayssac et al., 2018). This then inhibits the cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and CDK4. As a consequence, the retinoblastoma protein is hypophosphorylated and induces senescence (Lee et al., 2000; Dix 2018). The hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein leads to the inhibition of E2F (Dix, 2018; Jeffries & Krupenko, 2018). This group of genes is normally responsible for cell proliferation and therefore their inhibition causes senescence (Dix 2018). In addition to that, PP1 and PP2A directly interfere with Rb by dephosphorylating it (Dix 2018). These two phosphatases also inhibit the mTOR pathway that is associated with cell proliferation (Millner & Atilla-Gokcumen, 2020).Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is thought to induce cell proliferation and migration by binding to S1PR1 and S1PR5. This is downregulated in senescence (Trayssac et al., 2018). In cellular senescence, S1P has been shown to be depleted as a result of a downregulation of sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1), induced by p53. The downregulation of SK1 is thought to be due to its degradation induced by p53 (Kim et al., 2019). Moreover, S1P has hTERT as a direct target and promotes its stability (Magali et al., 2021). Furthermore, there is an increase in S1P binding to the S1P receptor 2 (S1PR2), which has been associated with the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and therefore the SASP. S1P is also thought to inhibit ceramide synthase 2 (CERS2), which catalyzes the conversion of sphingosine into ceramide (Magali et al., 2021). Sphingosine is increased in senescence cells by the increase of S1P-phopshatase (SGPP1) and the increase in acid ceramidase ASAH-1 SGPP1 catalyzes the conversion of S1P to sphingosine, while ASAH-1 catalyzes the conversion of ceramide to sphingosine (Munk et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2019). This causes the dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein, which further causes senescence (Trayssac et al., 2018).Ceramide can be synthesized de novo starting with the conversion of palmitoyl-CoA and serine to 3-ketodihydrosphingosine. Upregulation of ceramide synthase 4 (CERS4), which converts dihydro-sphingosine into dihydro-ceramide. CERS4 has been thought to be a key enzyme in two types of senescence: OIS and replicative senescence, by mediating its effects through the PP1-Rb-E2F axis (Dix, 2018)Galactosidase β1 (GLB1) and in glucosylceramidase (GBA), which catalyze the conversion of lactosylceramide to glucosylceramide and the conversion of glucosylceramide to ceramide, respectively, are upregulated in cellular senescence. Additionally, there is a decrease in glucosylceramidase synthase, which catalyzes the formation of glucosylceramide from ceramide (Flor et al., 2017).Activation of p53, due to DNA damage, leads to an increase of neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase 2) (Deevska et al., 2021; Jeffries & Krupenko, 2018). Moreover, it has been noted that in senescent cells, there are elevated levels of neutral sphingomyelinases ( Millner & Atilla-Gokcumen, 2020). These enzymes catalyze the conversion of sphingomyelin to ceramide (Gey & Seeger, 2013).Elevated ceramide levels result in elevated diacylglycerol (DAG) levels (Deevska et al., 2021). These two lipids are linked by sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SGMS2). SGMS2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphorycholine group from phosphatidylcholine to ceramide, yielding sphingomyelin and DAG.  In cellular senescence, SMS was found to be overexpressed. This caused an increase in DAG which caused the chronic activation of its downstream effectors. This causes the downregulation of protein kinase C α and β (PKCα and β) via the prolonged activation of phospholipase C. The consequences of this is the activation of p53 and p38, leading to SASP and senescence (Deevska et al., 2021).		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5122	Prostaglandin and leukotriene metabolism in senescence 		Prostaglandins are active lipid molecules that are shown to have a great impact on cellular senescence (Wiley et al., 2021). Prostaglandins are derived from arachidonic acid, which is cleaved by the enzyme cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) from the membrane phospholipids (Yang et al., 2011). The cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)-prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) pathway takes part in the induction, as well as the maintenance of senescence. COX-2 is the inducing enzyme which causes the conversion of AA into PGH2 and PGG2, which are then readily converted into PGF2⍺, PGD2, PGE2, PGI2, and TxA2 through prostaglandin synthases (Cormenier et al., 2017; Martien et al., 2013). The produced active prostaglandins can then act on intracellular receptors and trigger a downward signalling cascade, leading to the stimulation or inhibition of cAMP or the stimulation of Ca2+. The cAMP-dependent pathway leads to the stimulation of the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) production, which then also activates p53. P53 activation reinforces senescence by stimulating the expression of COX mRNA, thus creating a positive feedback loop (Yang et al., 2011).Two important active prostaglandins, namely dihomo-15d-PGJ2 and 15d-PGJ2 are highly elevated in senescent cells and induce COX-1 and 2, PTGES and PTGDS production through the activation of RAS and subsequently p53, reinforcing the positive feedback loop. Dihomo-15d-PGJ2 is the most highly elevated senescence-associated prostaglandin and is produced by the elongation of arachidonic acid into adrenic acid, which is then enzymatically converted to yield the prostaglandin. 15d-PGJ2 on the other hand is produced through the dehydration of the active prostaglandin PGD2. In addition, RAS stimulates the secretion of SASP factors, which can consequently affect surrounding cells (Wiley et al., 2021).Leukotrienes play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammation. Just like prostaglandins, leukotrienes are synthesized from arachidonic acid that was cleaved from the membrane phospholipids (Wiley et al., 2019). ALOX12, ALOX15, ALOX5AP, LTC4S, LTA4H, ALOX15B and ALOX5, which are enzymes that conversion of arachidonic acid to either leukotriene A4 (LT4A) or Arachidonic acid 5-hydroperoxide (5-HPETE), are upregulated in senescence (Wiley et al., 2019; HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤fner et al., 2019). The produced LTA4 can be converted into LTB4 or LTC4. LTC4 can then be consecutively cleaved into LTD4 and LTE4 (Suryadevara et al., 2020). All the mentioned leukotrienes are increased in cellular senescence and are thought to be part of the SASP (Lin & Xu, 2020).LTD4 is of particular importance in cellular senescence due to its increased interaction with the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT1R) (Wei et al., 2018; Song et al., 2019). This interaction has various consequences, such as the release of intracellular Ca2+, an increase of p21 and it also inhibits sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). SIRT1 regulates the cell cycle by inhibiting the phosphorylation of p53 and the release of various cytokines (Wei et al., 2018). Therefore, it increases the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and induce cellular senescence via the activation of p53 (Song et al., 2019).ALOX5 contributes to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Catalano et al., 2005; Menna et al., 2010). These ROS are thought to activate p53 which binds to ALOX5 and further increases its action (HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤fner et al., 2019). Moreover, ALOX5 uses Ca2+ as a cofactor and its increased intracellular concentration further promotes ALOX5's action (Menna et al., 2010). LTB4 is also stimulates the production of ROS. ALOX5 then stimulates the phosphorylation of p53 and activates p21 (Menna et al., 2010; Catalano et al., 2005). This then causes the dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (RB1). As a consequence, senescence is induced (Catalano et al., 2005).		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5123	Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation disorders		Fatty Acids (FAs) consists of several chain lengths (short, medium and long chain), which all need to be converted to CoA-bound esters to cross the inner mitochondrial membrane. The long-chain lengths however also need additional carnitine esterification.Several diseases are linked to the proteins in this pathway, which can be categorized into four groups: 1. entry of long-chain FAs into mitochondria disorders; 2. intra-mitochondrial beta-oxidation membrane-bound proteins defects involving long-chain FAs; 3. intra-mitochondrial beta-oxidation matrix proteins defects involving short and medium-chain FAs; 4. impaired electron transfer to Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5133	Non-classical role of vitamin D		Vitamin D is known for its participation in various skeletal and non-skeletal muscle homeostasis. In addition to Calcium (Ca²⁺) and phosphorous (P) absorption, its association with CVD, hypertention, cancer, obesity, diabetes and immune system has been reported. It actively participates in the regulation of cardiovascular system through Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS). Renin is secreted by the kidney and it activates the formation of angiotensin II that leads to the decreased production of nitric oxide (NO) and increased endothelial vascular dysfunction (Pérez-Hernández et al., 2016). Vitamin D causes the insulin release, facilitates muscle contraction and glucose uptake by enhancing the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) channels in the cells (Berridge, 2017) and reduces the aldosterone . From last few years vitamin D has gained special attention as immunomodulatory agent. The immunologic cells such as B cells, T cells, and antigen presenting cells express vitamin D receptors on their cells as well as are capable of synthesizing vitamin D metabolites especially calcitriol. The beneficial effects of vitamin D are linked with both innate and adaptive immune systems. During vitamin D deficiency an unwanted production of pro-inflammatory cytokines cause atherosclerotic lesions and atherogenesis. These conditions lead to increased vasoconstriction and decreased vasodilation, endothelial dysfunction, and alleviated nitric oxide formation. Furthermore, the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2; responsible for the retrospective production of Ang1-7 form Ang II) is also reduced in vitamin D deficient subjects. Such individuals are more vulnerable to infectious diseases, especially, recent pandemic of COVID-19 (Malek Mahdavi, 2020).		9606

Sialic acids are acidic sugar molecules that commonly occur as the terminal sugar as part of glycoproteins and glycolipids on the surface of cells. Sialylated conjugates play important roles in many processes, including cell recognition and signaling, neuronal development, cancer metastasis and bacterial or viral infection.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5166	Glyoxylate metabolism		The glyoxylate metabolism in hepatocytes is affected by primary hyperoxaluria (PH) types 1-3, leading to glyoxylate accumulation and hence, increased oxalate production, which is transported out of the hepatocytes by SLC26a1 transporters on the basolateral membrane into the blood and consequently, the kidneys, where it causes the occurrence of CaOx (calcium + oxalate) crystal deposition and hence, kidney stones. PH1 is caused due to a mutation of the AGT (glyoxylate aminotransferase) trimer, responsible for the conversion of glyoxylate into pyruvate in the peroxisome. PH2 is caused by mutations of glyoxylate reductase (GR), that converts 3-hydroxypyruvate into D-glycerate in the cytosol. It also catalyses the conversion of glyoxylate into glycolate. PH3 is linked to mutations on the HOGA1 gene, yielding the tetramer 4‐hydroxy‐2‐oxoglutarate aldolase, which acts in the mitochondrion to convert 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate to glyoxylate.Secondary hyperoxaluria is caused by (1) increased absorption of dietary oxalate through the GI tract or (2) increased consumption of dietary oxalate.There is an abundance of knowledge gaps in this pathway, specifically regarding the peroxisomal and mitochondrial transporters for several metabolites.This pathway is based on Physicians Guide to the Diagnosis, Treatment, and Follow-up of Inherited Metabolic Diseases by Nenad Blau Chapter 28 (Hyperoxalurias) (ISBN 3642403360).		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5169	Hemesynthesis defects and porphyrias		Defects in the heme biosynthesis in a hepatocyte can result in specific metabolic disorders called porphyrias. These diseases can be split into two categories, namely acute porphyrias and non-acute porphyrias. Acute hepatic porphyria (AIP), variegate porphyria (VP), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), and Doss porphyria (ALADP) are all part of the acute-hepatic porphyrias. This type is often associated with an overproduction of neurotoxic porphyrins and porphyrin precursors. The non-acute porphyrias include, porphyria cutanea tarda, erythropoietic porphyria, and congenital erythropoietic porphyria. These diseases are instead characterised by photosensitivity of the skin and in severe cases liver damage, caused by porphyrins. Another type of porphyria are the X-linked protoporphyria diseases, which are a result of a gain of function mutation in the 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase 2 gene. This causes an accumulation of protoporphyrin IX. The disease present in the patient is determined by what enzyme is affected in the heme biosynthesis pathway.This pathway has been constructed using chapter 33 of the book; Physician's Guide to the Diagnosis, Treatment, and Follow-Up of Inherited Metabolic Diseases (first edition), by N.Blau et al (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5171	Leukotriene metabolic pathway		This pathway shows an overview of leukotrienes biosynthesis and metabolism. Leukotrienes are a group of biologically active lipid mediators who are derived pre-dominantly from arachidonic acid via the 5-lipoxygenase pathways. This pathway follow two routes, one include cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4), the second starting at LTB4. This pathway is linked to five disorders, out of which three are caused by hereditary primary defects in one enzyme also know as Inherited Metabolic Disorders or IMDs/IEMs (disorders depicted in pink). The clinical presentation of LTC4 synthase deficiency includes muscular hypotonia, psychomotor retardation, microcephaly and failure to thrive. The other two defects, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase deficiency (GGT1 protein, also know as Glutathionuria) and membrane-bound dipeptidase deficiency (DPEP1 protein, responsible for a wide range of dipeptides hydrolytic reactions), have been studied to a lesser degree. Two additional disorders can be linked to this pathway: an increased risk of ischemic stroke is linked to the 5-LOAP protein (PMID:15640973 and 14770184) and deafness (ABCC1 autosomical dominant disorder, found in one family, severe hearing loss as adult, the relationship between the phenotype and gene is provisional).This pathway was inspired by Chapter 38 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5172	Iron metabolism disorders		This pathway was inspired by Figure 40.1 of Chapter 40 (ed. 4) of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).Intestinal iron is reduced by an cytochrome b reductase 1 (CYBRD1) and transported into intestinal cells by the divalent metal transporter SLC11A2 (or DMT1). Inside cells, iron is stored as ferritin (FT). On the basolateral side, iron leaves the epithelium via a basolateral transporter, SLC40A1 (or IREG1), followed by oxidation through the action of hephaestin (Heph), a membrane-bound ceruloplasmin-like multicopper ferroxidase. Iron-loaded transferrin (Fe2-Tf) binds to the transferrin receptor (TfRC) on the surface of cells. The receptor-transferrin complex, localized in clathrin-coated pits (TTTT), is invaginated and forms endosomes. These specialized endosomes acquire a low internal pH due to the action of a proton pump (not shown). This leads to the dissociation of the iron from transferrin. Iron can be converted into its ferrous form by the metalloreductase STEAP3 and then leave the endosomes via SLC11A2. Apo-transferrin and transferrin receptors recycle to the plasma membrane for reuse. This iron uptake mechanism is found in most cell types, including enterocyte precursor cells. Excess iron can leave at least some cell types via SLC40A1 and can be converted to its ferric form by ceruloplasmin (CP), a non-membrane multicopper ferroxidase. Hereditary hemochromatosis results from mutations in HFE. HFE forms a heterodimer with β2-microglobulin, and some mutations that lead to hemochromatosis interrupt this interaction and thus lead to excess iron accumulation. Defects in a second transferrin receptor, TfR2, have recently been implicated in type 3 hemochromatosis. Hepcidin (HAMP) modulates cellular iron export through ferroportin (SLC40A1) by internalizing it into vesicles when the iron concentration is high. HFE, TfR2 and HJV are Hepcidin regulators which are mutated in hereditary hemochromatosis.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5173	Disorders of galactose metabolism 		Galactose is converted into glucose 1-phosphate (G1P) through a series of steps called the Leloir pathway. The first step of the pathway is the phosphorylation of galactose by galactokinase (encoded GALK1) to yield galactose 1-phosphate. Conversion of galactose 1-phosphate to G1P requires the transfer of UDP from UDP-glucose catalyzed by GALT. UDP-galactose is converted to UDP-glucose by GALE. Glucose-1-phosphate is converted to glucose-6-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase (PGM) and vice versa.There are two known disorders concerning the uptake transports of galactose (SGLT1 and GLUT2 deficiency) and three known disorders of galactose metabolism: galactokinase deficiency (GALK-D), galactose 1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency (galactosemia, GALT-D) and uridine diphosphate galactose 4-epimerase deficiency (GALE-D).Among these, galactosemia is the most common and most severe. This pathway was inspired by Chapter 18, figure 18.3 of the book of Blau (4th edition; ISBN: 978-3-642-40337-8).		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5174	Ulcerative colitis signaling		Ulcerative colitis (UC) together with Crohn’s disease (CD) are both chronic inflammation disorders in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and subtypes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This inflammatory response in the GI tract is a result of various environmental and genetic components, microorganisms, and an impaired immune system. Among those many factors, changes in the luminal environment of the colonic epithelial cells are crucial and remain to be precisely analyzed. This pathway only considered UC, in which certain pathogens are found in increased or decreased amounts, compared to healthy controls. In the upper section of the pathway, it is shown that the toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognized the components derived from microbes, such as flagellin, peptidoglycan (PGN), and lipopolysaccharide. As depicted on the left, also nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) proteins, and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) recognized those microbial molecules. Activation of the TLR signaling pathway drives the upregulation of NF-kappa-B and its corresponding inflammation reaction. At the same time, the APC regulates the shift of naïve T-cells into effector T-cells and (Th2) and natural killer (NKT) T-cells. UC is mainly dominated by the Th2-type inflammation and the corresponding production of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and IL-10.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5175	Disorders in ketone body synthesis		Ketone bodies, acetoacetate and (beta)3-hydroxybutyric acid, are produced in times of hunger/starvation. The compounds are water-soluble (and also include the spontaneous breakdown product of acetoacetate, acetone). All ketone bodies are by-products when fatty acids are broken down for energy in the liver and kidneys, and used as energy source for the heart and brain.Ketogenesis can be impeded by inborn errors of metabolism such as Methylacetoacetyl-CoA thiolase deficiency, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase deficiency and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency. In this pathway ketogenesis is visualised and linked to the different diseases. Ketogenesis can derive from leucine metabolism and fatty acid beta-oxidation and happens in the mitochondria. The enzymes ACAT1, HMGCS2, HMGCL and BDH1 play an important role during this proces. This pathway is based on chapter 23 of the book of Blau et al. (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)), Figures 23.1 and 23.2.For the ketolysis pathway see: [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP5195 WP5195]		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5176	Disorders of bile acid synthesis and biliary transport		This pathway model displays disorders of bile acid synthesis and biliary transport. Bile acids have a crucial role in the absorption of lipids and hydrophilic vitamins. Furthermore, bile acids aid in themaintenance of cholesterol homeostasis, excretion of toxic substances, processing of food intake, and used as signaling moleculesinfluencing glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and energy expenditure.First, bile acids with a low solubility (less hydrophilic, unconjugated) must be activated using CoA, so that conjugation to taurine or glycine can happen.This model includes 20 disorders, of which 14 are enzyme deficiencies, and 6 are related to transporters. The enzyme deficiencies include 3β-Dehydrogenase deficiency, 5β-Reductase deficiency, Spastic Paraplegia 5A, Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase deficiency, Sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency, α-Methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) deficiency, Bile acid amidation defect, and Bile acid-CoA ligase deficiency (BA CoA LD, BACS), congenital bile acid synthesis defect 6 and type 5, D-bifunctional protein deficiency, sterol carrier protein 2 deficiency. Disorders of transporters are related to deficiencies in ATP8B1 (Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1; PFIC1), ABCB11 (Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2; PFIC 2), ABCB4 (Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3), and ABCC2 (Dubin-Johnson syndrome), as well as Rotor Syndrome (linked to two distinct genes, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, related to taurocholate and glycocholate transport). This pathway is based on Chapter 34 of Blau’s ‘Physicians Guide to the Diagnosis, Treatment, and Follow-Up of Inherited Metabolic Diseases (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)), edition 4 (and is currently in the process of being updated to edition 5, Chapter 56). We would like to thank two authors from this chapter (Frédéric M. Vaz and Sacha Ferdinandusse) for their efforts in curating this pathway model!		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5178	Disorders of fructose metabolism		"Fructose is converted into fructose-1-phosphate, this reaction is facilitated by fructokinase (also called ketohexokinase)(encoded by KHK). Connected to this reaction is the metabolic disease ""essential fructosuria"" which causes a deficiency in fructokinase. After this fructose-1-phosphate is converted into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone-phosphate, this is facilitated by aldolase B (encoded by ALDOB). connected to this reaction is the metabolic disease ""hereditary fructose intolerance"", which is the result of the absence of aldolase B. The glyceraldehyde produced from this reaction will be converted into D-glycerate through the activity of Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member A1 or ALDH1A1 (encoded by the ALDH1A1 gene). The D-glycerate will be converted (according to the book) into 2-Phosphoglyceric acid through the activity of Glycerate kinase (encoded by GLYCTK), connected to this reaction is the metabolic disease ""glycerate kinase deficiency"" which results in the accumulation of D-glycerate. The resulting 2-phosphoglyceric acid then goes through a series of reactions resulting in pyruvate.Another entry into this pathway is through the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate into fructose-6-phosphate through glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (encoded by GPI). The fructose-6-phosphate can be converted into fructose-1,6-biphosphate through phosphofructokinase (encoded by PFKL). Fructose-1,6-biphosphate can be converted into fructose-6-phosphate by fructose-1,6-biphosphatase, connected to this reaction is the metabolic disease ""Fructose-1,6-biphosphatase deficiency"". When going further, the fructose-1,6-biphosphate is converted into dihydroxyacetone-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate through the activity of aldolase B, this reaction is also affected by hereditary fructose intolerance. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is then eventually turned into pyruvate through a series of reactions. The dihydroxyacetone-phosphate resulting from the aldolase B involved reactions can be converted into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate through the activity of triose-phosphate isomerase (encoded by TPI1).This pathway is based on the fructose metabolism pathway (Chapter 18, Figure 18.5) in the book Physicians Guide to the Diagnosis, Treatment, and Follow-Up of Inherited Metabolic Diseases (ed. 4) by Nenad Blau, Marinus Duran, K Michael Gibson, Carlo Dionisi.(ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361))"		9606

Consequently, 1-deoxysphingolipids cannot be converted to complex sphingolipids and are not degraded over the canonical catabolic pathways. Further conversion of 1-deoxysphingosine is done by members of the CYP4A/F family. It is however not clear which specific genes are involved in these processes.		9606

The gene is located in the so-called ""Down syndrome critical region"" (DSCR), a region on chromosome 21 thought responsible for most phenotypic manifestations of Down syndrome. DYRK1A is involved in signaling pathways regulating cell proliferation in brain development. Amongst others, haploinsufficiency of DYRK1A, DYRK1A overexpression and interactions with alpha-synuclein are thought to be the main factors for the clinical phenotype."		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5181	Roles of ceramides in development of insulin resistance		Ceramides and insulin resistance are connectedd. Ceramides are accumulated in tissues due to an excess of saturated fatty acids. In obese subjects, the amount of ceramides found in skeletal muscles is nearly double that of healthy subjects. Ceramides are produced mostly by the sphingolipid pathway. Besides the sphingolipid pathway, ceramides are also produced by the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin with the catalysis of nSMase2. In the cell, ceramides play a role in insulin resistance. Ceramides inhibit the binding of PDX-1 and MAFA transcription factors to insulin promoter. Ceramides cause ER stress, which activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPK8 and EIF2AK2. This leads to the upregulation of serine phosphorylation while downregulating tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. That, in turn, leads to the inhibition of recruitment and activation of PI3K. This leads to a downregulation in AKT1, an enzyme that stimulates the translocation of GLUT4. Ceramides also impair mitochondria functions and inhibit fatty acid oxidation, eventually leading to ROS and inflammation. Ceramides activate protein PP2A, which promotes the dephosphorylation of AKT1. PKCζ is also activated by ceramides to inhibit the activity of AKT1. Moreover, palmitoyl-CoA downregulates the phosphorylation of AMPK, which leads to the increase of ER stress in the cell and decreases in fatty acid oxidation. On the other hand, oleic acid inhibits the downregulation of AMPK caused by palmitoyl-CoA. Oleic acid also increases the expression of CPT1B, stimulating the fatty acid oxidation to reduce the inflammation in the cell.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5182	Pro-survival signaling of neuroprotectin D1		Uncompensated oxidative stress triggers neuroprotectin D1 to inhibit caspase activity via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and via the stimulation of BIRC3 leading to pro-survival stimuli. By inhibiting the formation of the Bax/Bcl-xL complex in the mitochondrial membrane, NPD1 decreases the release of Cytochrome c leading to a lower pro-apoptotic activity. Furthermore, NPD1 inhibits the internalization of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) which is involved in the initiation of apoptosis, thereby promoting survival of the cell. The neuroprotective effect of NPD1 therefore contributes to the management of diseases like Alzheimer's disease, stroke, age-related macular degeneration, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerations.		9606

To understand the (molecular) mechanisms underlying Long COVID-19 and the potential role of chronic oxidative stress, this pathway concisely visualises mitochondrial hijacking by SARS-COV-2 leading to pro-senescent mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5186	Vitamin K metabolism and activation of dependent proteins		Vitamin K is recycled in the liver in order to maintain sufficient levels for activating vitamin K-dependent proteins (VKDP), including certain coagulation factors. In this process, vitamin K1 (taken up from the diet) is converted to vitamin K hydroquinone (KH2), either by the dithiol-dependent vitamin K-epoxide reductase (VKOR) or by NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1. KH2 is in turn oxidized to vitamin K epoxide (KO) by the enzyme gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX). During this conversion, GGCX activates the VKDPs by converting glutamate (Glu) to gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla). Lastly, KO is converted back into vitamin K quinone by VKOR. Warfarin, a drug commonly used as a anticoagulant, inhibits VKOR, thus reducing the levels of VKH2 in the bloodstream.A too high dosage of warfarin can lead to heavy bleeding, a life-threatening condition.Threatment of this condition is a high dosis of Vitamine K, which is reduced to VHK2 by FSP1, a warfarin resistant reductase.The influence of FSP1 on this process, as well as its potential to eliminate lipid perozyl radicals, has been recently described in [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05022-3 Nature(2022)] by Mishima et al.: A non-canonical vitamin K cycle is a potent ferroptosis suppressor.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5188	Retinol metabolism		This pathway describes the metabolism of retinol. Retinol, more common known as vitamin A, is involved in various physiological processes in the human body.Vitamin A must acquired from the diet.

There are many carries proteins and enzymes specific to retinoid metabolism involved in the processes.		9606

Copper is ingested through diet, absorbed by enterocytes in the intestinal walls, and sent to hepatocytes via the hepatic portal system.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5190	Creatine pathway		In humans, creatine is synthesized in the liver, pancreas, kidney and brain. From arginine and glycine, guanidinoacetate and ornithine are formed. With S-adenosylmethionine and the help of GAMT, guanidinoacetate is converted into creatine. From the liver, pancreas, kidney and brain, creatine is exported to tissues such as skeletal muscle and brain, where it undergoes phosphorylation and serves as a short-term energy store. Creatine is transported to these tissues with the help of SLC6A8 transporter. Once formed, phosphocreatine and creatine undergo both a slow spontaneous reaction to form creatinine, which is excreted from the body via the urinary system. This pathway was inspired by Chapter 32 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361) ed. 4).		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP521	Amino acid conjugation of benzoic acid		Despite being the first conjugation reaction demonstrated in humans, amino acid conjugation as a route of metabolism of xenobiotic carboxylic acids is not well characterised. This is principally due to the small number and limited structural diversity of xenobiotic substrates for amino acid conjugation. Unlike CYP and uridine 5′-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase, which are localised in the endoplasmic reticulum, the enzymes of amino acid conjugation reside in mitochondria. Unique among drug metabolism pathways, amino acid conjugation involves initial formation of a xenobiotic acyl-CoA thioester that is then conjugated principally with glycine in humans. Exogenously administered benzoic acid is metabolised to hippuric acid with a conjugation reaction in humans (as discovered in the first metabolism study in humans).		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5216	Warburg effect modulated by deubiquitinating enzymes and their substrates		Even in the presence of oxygen, cancer cells convert glucose to lactate as their main source for energy production, instead of using the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. This process is called the Warburg effect. This pathway shows the effects deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and their substrates have. DUBs free proteins of their ubiquitin chain, so that the proteins can resume their function in the cells rather than be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). The deubiquitination of VHL via OTUD6B (part of a DUB subfamily) represses HIF-1α, whereas the direct deubiquitination of HIF-1a via DUBs leads to the increased expression of GLUT1 and VEGF. The transcription factor c-Myc helps regulate gene expression involved in the glucose metabolism (e.g., GLUT1, HK2, LDHA) and is stabilised by ubiquitin-specific proteases.  The PI3K/Akt pathway is also upregulated by deubiquitination of VEGF and Akt. This entails cell growth and apoptosis regulation, as well as promoted glucose transport to cancer cells and activating mTor, which improves glycolysis.It is shown in this pathway, how deubiquitinating enzymes play an important role in stabilizing different proteins, acting as oncoproteins and tumor suppressors equally.This pathway is based on figure 3 featured in “Regulation of Cancer Metabolism by Deubiquitinating Enzymes: The Warburg Effect” by So-Hee Kim and Kwang-Hyun Baek.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5235	Estradiol regulation in porto-sinusoidal vascular disease		Porto-sinusoidal vascular disease (PSVD) is a rare disease (Schouten et al., 2015), affecting less than 1 in 2000 citizens (European standard) (Griffon et al., 2016). It is characterized by signs of presinusoidal portal hypertension without cirrhosis, where the cause of the hypertension is unknown (Lee et al., 2016; Schouten et al., 2011). Based on that what is known about the etiology of PSVD, its development can be categorized into five groups: immunological disorders, chronic infections, exposure to medications or toxins, prothrombic conditions, and genetic predisposition (Schouten et al., 2015). In practice, the disease has multiple contributing factors (Siramolpiwat et al., 2016). This pathway describes a mutation in the KCNN3 gene that is hypothesized to result in genetic predisposition to PSVD (Koot et al., 2016). PSVD has also been referred as idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (INCPH), hepatoportal sclerosis, incomplete septal cirrhosis, obliterative portal venopathy, partial nodular transformation, non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH), and idiopathic portal hypertension (Schouten et al., 2015; Siramolpiwat et al., 2016; Besmond et al., 2017).		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5269	Genetic causes of porto-sinusoidal vascular disease		Porto sinusoidal vascular disease (PSVD), or formerly known as idiopathic portal vein hypertension (INCPH), is a condition with often unclear origin. There are currently three genes directly linked to this condition: C4orf54, a protein with unknown function, DGUOK, a desoxyguanosine kinase involved in purine metabolism, and KCNN3, a potassium channel regulated i.a. via estradiol. Additionally, some genetic syndromes show increased portal vein hypertension as one of their symptoms/phenotypes. These syndromes are X-linked agammaglobulinemia, Adams-Oliver syndrome, chronic granulomatous disease and Shwachmann syndrome.X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is caused by mutations in BTK. BTK is involved in signal transduction from virus single stranded RNA recognition by toll like receptors (TLR8 and TLR9) to NFKB1 mediated gene expression as response. Adams-Oliver Syndrome can be caused by mutations in RBPJ, ARHGAP31, DOCK6, DLL4, EOGT and NOTCH1. Most of these genes are involved in the Notch pathway but there is also a link via RAC1 to the phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex (ComplexPortal). Mutations in some proteins of this complex (CYBA, NCF1, NCF2 or NCF4), or their chaperones (CYBC1) can cause chronic granulomatous disease.  Shwachmann syndrome is caused by mutations in SBDS or EFL1 which are both part of the pre-60S ribosomal subunit and are responsible for cleaving off the EIF6 protein for maturation to 60S ribosomal subunit.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP53	ID signaling pathway		The Inhibitor of DNA binding (ID) proteins belong to the class V HLH family of transcription factors. Four ID proteins (ID 1-4)are known in humans. Unlike the basic HLH (bHLH) transcription factors, ID proteins lack the basic DNA binding region. They can heterodimerize with class I bHLH transcription factors to form inactive complexes. They thus act as dominant negative inhibitors of the class I bHLH transcription factors. They are also capable of regulating the activity of class II HLH transcription factors. Since, class I and II HLH proteins regulate the expression of cell type-specific genes and differentiated phenotype, ID proteins are thought to regulate the cross-talk between the pathways involved in cell growth and differentiation. Aberrant expression of ID proteins are found in many primary tumors and are found to regulate many steps in cancer progression including neo-angiogenesis, invasion and migration, proliferation and growth, cell-cell interaction and differentiation. These include head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, hepatocellular carcinonoma, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer  and prostate cancer. Among the transcription factors that ID proteins associate with are the Ets family members (ELKs)  and paired box family (PAXs). They can also bind to the retinoblastoma and retinoblastoma-like proteins (RBLs), which are thought to be tumor suppressors. IDs can also be phosphorylated by CDK2.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP531	DNA mismatch repair		DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is responsible for correcting mismatches and small insertions and deletions caused during replication and recombination. In eukaryotes the process of MMR is initiated by MutSalpha and MutLalpha, homologs of the E.coli proteins MutS and MutL. MutS homologs first recognize the error in DNA, and then physically interact with MutL, which activates other proteins that remove the erroneous DNA strand and synthesize a new one. ''In vitro'' MMR requires a nick requires a preexisting nick (single-strand gap) in the DNA substrate. Similarly, it is thought that for ''in vivo'' MMR in eukaryotes, newly synthesized lagging-strand DNA transiently contains nicks (before being sealed by DNA ligase) which provides a signal that directs mismatch proofreading systems to the appropriate strandThis pathway describes the slightly different mechanisms for MMR based on the location of the nick in relation to the mismatch (5' and 3'). Mutations in the genes coding human MutS and MutL homologs have been linked with the Lynch syndrome, which is characterized by an increased risk of developing cancer.This pathway is based on figure 1 from [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28356513/ Hsieh et al], with additional information from [http://repairtoire.genesilico.pl/Pathway/10/ REPAIRtoire], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_mismatch_repair Wikipedia] and [https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+hsa03430 KEGG].

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5312	Metabolic pathways of fibroblasts		Fibroblasts are known to contribute to tissue and organ connectivity by producing and secreting extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Although several diseases, such as fibrosis and cancer, have been linked to changes in fibroblast metabolism, the resting metabolic conditions that are present in healthy cells generally go unreported. Because fibroblasts are known to display heterogeneity, the metabolic processes of different tissues may vary. The aim was to identify and map out the general metabolic pathways present in fibroblasts. The pathways for collagen, serine, and proline, as well as glycosaminoglycan synthesis, are nearly complete. Nonetheless, dashed arrows indicate missing process steps that should be identified and included. There is a lack of data on fibroblasts' metabolic activities, and further research is required to understand the complete metabolic pathways of fibroblasts.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5313	Carnosine metabolism of glial cells		This pathway shows the synthesis and degradation of Carnosine as well as the distribution within glial cells in the brain. The synthesis pathway starts at two different locations, with beta-alanine being transported from the liver and l-histidine being transported from the intestines, since it needs to be ingested. As can be seen, various transports bring these two amino acids across the blood brain barrier and into the oligodendrocyte where the actual synthesis of carnosine happens by CARNS1. The degradation of carnosine also occurs within the oligodendrocyte by CN1 and CN2. The oligdendrocytes are the only glial cells in the brain which produce carnosine, but all of them use it, so distribution to other glial cells is necessary. The transport to microglia is done by SLC14A2 and 4, while transport to astrocytes only requires SLC14A2.Carnosine also has an impact on the glutamate transporter of the astrocyte, which is SLC1A2, also known as GLT-1. Carnosine stimulates the transporter, which brings more glutamate and sodium into the cell. The sodium concentration within the cell will be increased, leading to a higher activity of the ATPase. This generates more ADP, which can be used within glycolysis. This then builds a connected to the lactate shuttle which occurs between the astrocyte and neurons, in which the astrocyte produces lactate from pyruvate to give the neurons additional energy support.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5314	Lactate shuttle in glial cells		Astrocyte-Neuron lactate shuttle in Homo Sapiens. The pathway shows the relation between neuronal activity and lactate production in astrocytes. These shuttles show how lactate can be broken down by lactate dehydrogenase into pyruvate which enters the TCA cycle in neurons. In the astrocytes, the glucose undergoes glycolysis to be converted into pyruvate, which is then converted into lactate with the help of the LDHA enzyme. Lactate is then transported from the astrocytes to the neurons through the transporters SLC16A1, SLC16A3 and SLC16A7. There, lactate is converted to pyruvate with the help of the LDHB enzyme. Pyruvate formation is also increased by glucose entering the neuron through the SLC2A3 transporter, which undergoes glycolysis. Pyruvate enters the TCA cycle in the mitochondria of the neuron and ATP is produced. The ATP generated in the neurons is required for the glutamate neurotransmitters to be excreted from the neurons into the synaptic cleft. The astrocytes take up the glutamate neurotransmitters through the transporter SLC1A2. For glutamate to be transported into the cell by the SLC1A2 transporter, Na+ must be cotransported into the cell. This increase in concentration of sodium ions inside of the astrocyte is balanced by Na+/K+ ATPase which transports Na+ out of the cell while simultaneously transporting K+ into the cell. This transporter requires ATP to be activated, and the ADP produced can be regenerated into ATP during glycolysis in the astrocytes. This lactate shuttle theory explains that lactate from astrocytes is preferentially used over glucose by neurons in a fully aerobic state and is the main supply of energy to our neurological system.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5321	Prostaglandin and leukotriene metabolism in senescence 		Prostaglandins are active lipid molecules that are shown to have a great impact on cellular senescence (Wiley et al., 2021). Prostaglandins are derived from arachidonic acid, which is cleaved by the enzyme cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) from the membrane phospholipids (Yang et al., 2011). The cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)-prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) pathway takes part in the induction, as well as the maintenance of senescence. COX-2 is the inducing enzyme which causes the conversion of AA into PGH2 and PGG2, which are then readily converted into PGF2âŤş, PGD2, PGE2, PGI2, and TxA2 through prostaglandin synthases (Cormenier et al., 2017; Martien et al., 2013). The produced active prostaglandins can then act on intracellular receptors and trigger a downward signalling cascade, leading to the stimulation or inhibition of cAMP or the stimulation of Ca2+. The cAMP-dependent pathway leads to the stimulation of the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) production, which then also activates p53. P53 activation reinforces senescence by stimulating the expression of COX mRNA, thus creating a positive feedback loop (Yang et al., 2011).Two important active prostaglandins, namely dihomo-15d-PGJ2 and 15d-PGJ2 are highly elevated in senescent cells and induce COX-1 and 2, PTGES and PTGDS production through the activation of RAS and subsequently p53, reinforcing the positive feedback loop. Dihomo-15d-PGJ2 is the most highly elevated senescence-associated prostaglandin and is produced by the elongation of arachidonic acid into adrenic acid, which is then enzymatically converted to yield the prostaglandin. 15d-PGJ2 on the other hand is produced through the dehydration of the active prostaglandin PGD2. In addition, RAS stimulates the secretion of SASP factors, which can consequently affect surrounding cells (Wiley et al., 2021).Leukotrienes play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammation. Just like prostaglandins, leukotrienes are synthesized from arachidonic acid that was cleaved from the membrane phospholipids (Wiley et al., 2019). ALOX12, ALOX15, ALOX5AP, LTC4S, LTA4H, ALOX15B and ALOX5, which are enzymes that conversion of arachidonic acid to either leukotriene A4 (LT4A) or Arachidonic acid 5-hydroperoxide (5-HPETE), are upregulated in senescence (Wiley et al., 2019; HĂ�Ć’Ă†â€™Ă�â€šĂ‚Â¤fner et al., 2019). The produced LTA4 can be converted into LTB4 or LTC4. LTC4 can then be consecutively cleaved into LTD4 and LTE4 (Suryadevara et al., 2020). All the mentioned leukotrienes are increased in cellular senescence and are thought to be part of the SASP (Lin & Xu, 2020).LTD4 is of particular importance in cellular senescence due to its increased interaction with the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT1R) (Wei et al., 2018; Song et al., 2019). This interaction has various consequences, such as the release of intracellular Ca2+, an increase of p21 and it also inhibits sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). SIRT1 regulates the cell cycle by inhibiting the phosphorylation of p53 and the release of various cytokines (Wei et al., 2018). Therefore, it increases the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and induce cellular senescence via the activation of p53 (Song et al., 2019).ALOX5 contributes to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Catalano et al., 2005; Menna et al., 2010). These ROS are thought to activate p53 which binds to ALOX5 and further increases its action (HĂ�Ć’Ă†â€™Ă�â€šĂ‚Â¤fner et al., 2019). Moreover, ALOX5 uses Ca2+ as a cofactor and its increased intracellular concentration further promotes ALOX5's action (Menna et al., 2010). LTB4 is also stimulates the production of ROS. ALOX5 then stimulates the phosphorylation of p53 and activates p21 (Menna et al., 2010; Catalano et al., 2005). This then causes the dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (RB1). As a consequence, senescence is induced (Catalano et al., 2005).		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5356	Disturbed pathways in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy		DMD (Duchenne muscular dystrophy) is a genetic disorder that primarily affects muscles in the body, causing progressive muscle weakness and wasting. It is caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which results in a deficiency or absence of the protein dystrophin, leading to muscle degeneration.DMD is characterized by abnormal calcium levels resulting from dysfunction in the muscle cell membrane. This leads to the uncontrolled opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) which inhibits ATP synthesis and thus, drives the cell into apoptosis. This influx activates a cascade of harmful events, including increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of proteases that can damage the cell structure of muscle fibers. The lack of the dystrophin protein affects essential components for muscle contraction namely the Disassembled Dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DAPC) which disturbs the normal contraction-relaxation process of the muscle in DMD. Sustained contractions occur due to the high calcium influx causing muscle stiffness and fibrosis, which are known characteristics of DMD. Indeed, fibrosis is commonly stimulated in dystrophic muscle cells as a result of the upregulation of several pro-fibrotic transcription factors such as SERPINE1, SCX and GL1. Hence, excessive amounts of collagen and fibronectin are produced, enhancing fibrosis. All these events cause chronic inflammation in the muscle cell, attracting pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and other inflammatory mediators. The chronic inflammation in DMD can further perpetuate muscle degeneration, fibrosis, and impaired muscle function.Acknowledgments: Bria Jackson, Amaia Alvarez van Schie, Otto Rämö, Tuneille Adelaar		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP536	Calcium regulation in cardiac cells		Calcium is a common signaling mechanism, as once it enters the cytoplasm it exerts allosteric regulatory affects on many enzymes and proteins. Calcium can act in signal transduction after influx resulting from activation of ion channels or as a second messenger caused by indirect signal transduction pathways such as G protein-coupled receptors. Movement of calcium ions from the extracellular compartment to the intracellular compartment alters membrane depolarisation. This is seen in the heart, during the plateau phase of ventricular contraction. In this example, calcium acts to maintain depolarisation of the heart.Source: [[wikipedia:Calcium_signaling|Wikipedia]]Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP536 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606

KCNQ genes code for Kv7 subunits, which are required for Kv7 channels in the brain. These channels, also known as the M channels, are required for an outward potassium flow, known as the M current. Mutations in KCNQ genes and genes associated with Kv7 channel function can result in the impairment of this potassium flow. This leads to a constant state of depolarization in the neuron cells, which leads to increased excitabilty and a constant firing of action potentials, resulting in types of epilepsy.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5368	Sulfatase and aromatase pathway		"The intratumoral production of estradiol-17beta (E2) from circulating steroid hormone precursors plays an essential role in estrogen-related breast and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). There are two possible pathways producing E2, one being the sulfatase pathway starting from estrone sulfate, and one being the aromatase pathway which starts with DHEA-S. Both routes rely on two crucial enzymes: STS for estrogen activation and SULT1E1 for inactivation. Research indicates that an increased STS expression and E2 production is associated with cancer progression. However, sulfonation of E2 via SULT1E1 not only reduces proliferative effects of estrogens on hormone-sensitive tumor cells, but also generates water-soluble estrogen sulfates consequently leading to an increased excretion of sulfonated E2. This helps preventing a metabolic activation of the hormone into potentially mutagenic catechol metabolites. Thus, targeting estrogen-modifying enzymes is a potential endocrine therapy strategy for patients with estrogen-sensitive EOC.This pathway is based on Figure 1 from: Mungenast, F., Aust, S., Vergote, I., Vanderstichele, A., Sehouli, J., Braicu, E., Mahner, S., Castillo‑Tong, D.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5382	TGF&beta;/Smad signaling pathway		Regulation of TGFβ/Smad Signaling Pathway in Trabecular Meshwork (TM) cells. In this pathway, TGF-β binds to the TGF-β-type II receptor, inducing the activation of the TGF-β-type-I receptor. This induces the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 proteins which form a complex with Smad4. The translocation of this complex to the nucleus is facilitated by the TAZ protein.  Once in the nucleous, it binds to SBEs (Smad Binding Elements), promoting the transcription of TGF-beta-response genes. The inhibition of this translocation instead occurs when phosphorylated TAZ protein interacts with 14-3-3 protein preventing the formation of complex TAZ-Smad. The translated ECM proteins are secreted by TM cells to the extracellular space.

It takes place in the cytosol, where it starts with the conversion of D-glucopyranose to D-glucopyranose 6-phosphate, after which it can either proceed via a shorter or a longer path. The shorter leads to the synthesis of UDP-α-D-galactose, UDP-α-D-glucuronate and UDP-α-D-xylose, while the longer leads to the synthesis of UDP-N-acetyl-α-D-galactosamine and UDP-N-acetyl-α-D-glucosamine.

This pathway shows the metabolic reactions necessary to synthesize three types of GAGs, namely chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. The synthesis takes place in the Golgi apparatus and begins with UDP-α-D-xylose. After this molecule is converted to 3-β-D-glucosyluronate-3-β-D-galactosyl-4-β-D-galactosyl-O-β-D-xylosyl-[protein] via three metabolic reactions, the pathway separates into two branches. One of them leads to the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate and dermatan (di)sulfate, while the other ends with heparan mono-, bi- or trisulfate. Some of the reactions are catalyzed by unknown enzymes that should be researched in the future.This pathway was created based on the information from the pathways found in MetaCyc and HumanCyc databases (see Bibliography). As some of the metabolites do not have identifiers in databases supported by PathVisio (such as ChEBI or KEGG), their MetaNetX IDs were added in the comments.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5411	Phosphatidyl inositol phosphate pathway		Glycerophospholipids or phosphoglycerides, in which the hydrophobic regions are composed of two fatty acids joined to glycerol; and sphingolipids, in which a single fatty acid is joined to a fatty amine, sphingosine, are glycerol-based phospholipids and the main component of biological membranes. The hydrophilic moieties in these amphipathic compounds may be as a simple as a single -OH at one end of the sterol ring system, or they may be more complex. Glycerophospholipds, as well as sphingolipids, contained polar or charged alcohols at their polar ends; some also contain phosphate groups.In glycerophospholipids, two fatty acids are ester-linked to glycerol at C-1 and C-2, and a highly polar or charged (and therefore hydrophilic) head group is attached to C-3 through a phosphodiester bond. All glycerophospholipds are derivatives of phosphatidic acid and are named for their polar head groups (e.g., phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine). All have a negative charge on the phosphate group at pH 7.0. The head-goup alcohol may also contribute one or more charges at pH near 7.0. The fatty acids in glycerophospholipds can be any of a wide variety. They are different in different species, in different tissues of the same species, and in different types of glycerophospholipids in the same cell or tissue. In general, glycerophospholipids contain a saturated fatty acid at C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid at C-2, and, in general terms, the fatty acyl groups are generally 16 or 18 carbons long.Eukaryotic membranes contain significant amounts of two other types of glycerophospholipids: Plasmalogens and Alkylacylglycerophospholipids. Plasmalogens contain a hydrocarbon chain linked to glycerol C-1 via vinyl ether linkage whereas alkylacylglycerophospholipids the alkyl substituent at glycerol C-1 is attached via an ether linkage. About 20% of mammalian glycerophospholipids are plasmalogens, this percentage varies both from species to species and from tissue to tissue within a given organism. While plasmalogens comprise only about 0.8% of the phospholipids in human liver, they account for around 23% of those in human nervous tissue. The alkylacylglycerophospholipids are less abundant than the plasmalogens, e.g., about 59% of ethanolamine glycerophospholipids of human heart are plasmalogens, whereas only 3.6% are alkylacylglycerophospholipids. However, in bovine erythrocytes, 75% of the ethanolamine glycerophospholipids are of alkylacyl type.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5413	IL-24 Signaling pathway		Interleukin 24 (IL-24) is a pleiotropic immunoregulatory cytokine belonging to the family of IL-10 cytokine. IL-24 is the only member of the IL-10 cytokine family with tumor-suppressing, anti-angiogenic, and metastasis-inhibiting properties. The activation of IL-24 induces complex downstream signaling pathways that culminate in anti-tumor activities. This dual functional cytokine is known to induce tumor suppressive activity in various cancers including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), melanoma, lung, breast, pancreatic, hepatocellular, colorectal, and cervical cancer. Furthermore, the activation of IL-24 leads to the modulation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses, as well as promotes immune defense against infections. Because of its multifaceted anti-tumor and immuno-regulating properties, IL-24 can be a potential therapeutic intervention for a wide range of pathophysiological conditions.		9606

Kyn is converted to 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) by kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO), to anthranilic acid (AA) by kynureninase (KYNase), or to kynurenic acid (KYNA) by kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT). Next, catalyzed by KYNase, 3-HK is converted to 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA), which is further converted to quinolinic acid (QA), picolinic acid, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), and other molecules.Starting point: https://pfocr.wikipathways.org/figures/PMC6090955__13045_2018_644_Fig1_HTML.html		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP545	Complement activation		The complement system is a biochemical cascade that helps, or complements, the ability of antibodies to clear pathogens from an organism. It is part of the immune system called the innate immune system that is not adaptable and does not change over the course of an individual's lifetime. However, it can be recruited and brought into action by the adaptive immune system. The Classical pathway of activation of the complement system is a group of blood proteins that mediate the specific antibody response. [source: Wikipedia]The Classical pathway begins with circulating C1Q binding to an antigen on the surface of a pathogen, which goes on to active and recruit 2 copies of each C1R and C1S, forming a C1 complex. The activated C1 complex cleaves C2 and C4. Activated cleavage products C2A and C4B combine to form  C3 convertase, which cleaves C3. The cleavage product C3B joins the complex to form C5 convertase, which cleaves C5. The cleavage product C5B joins C6, C7, C8 and multiple copies of C9 to form the Membrane Attack Complex, which forms a channel for water to flood into the target cell, leading to osmotic lysis. The Decay accelerating factor (DAF) inhibits C3 convertase.The Lectin pathway involves mannose-binding lectin (MBL) binding the surface of the pathogen instead of C1Q. MBL-associated serine proteases MASP1 and MASP1 can cleave C2 and C4 in place of the C1 complex, leading to the formation of C3 convertase and the subsequent cascade.The Alternative pathway relies on the spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 and the cleavage of factor B (CFB) by factor D (CFD), which form an alternative C3 convertase stabilized by factor P (CFP). Additional copies of the cleavage product C3B are recruited to the complex, resulting in an alternative C5 convertase, which cleaves C5 and contributes C5B to the formation of the Membrane Attack Complex.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP545 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606

Kinin peptides are implicated in many physiological and pathological processes including the regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis, inflammatory processes, and the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning.Complement is a system of plasma proteins that is activated by the presence of pathogens. There are three pathways of complement activation: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. All of these pathways generate a crucial enzymatic activity that, intern, generates the effector molecules of complement. The three main consequences of complement activation are the opsonization of pathogens, the recruitment of inflammatory and immunocompetent cells, and the direct killing of pathogens.Source: KEGG Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP558 CPTAC Assay Portal]		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP560	TGF-beta receptor signaling		The Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway is involved in many cellular processes in both the adult organism and the developing embryo including cell growth, cell differentiation, apoptosis, cellular homeostasis and other cellular functions. In spite of the wide range of cellular processes that the TGFβ signaling pathway regulates, the process is relatively simple. TGFβ superfamily ligands bind to a type II receptor, which recruits and phosphorylates a type I receptor. The type I receptor then phosphorylates receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs) which can now bind the coSMAD SMAD4. R-SMAD/coSMAD complexes accumulate in the nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the regulation of target gene expression.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP561	Heme biosynthesis		The enzymatic process that produces heme is properly called porphyrin synthesis, as all the intermediates are tetrapyrroles that are chemically classified are porphyrins. The process is highly conserved across biology. In humans, this pathway serves almost exclusively to form heme. In other species, it also produces similar substances such as cobalamin (vitamin B12).The pathway is initiated by the synthesis of D-Aminolevulinic acid (dALA or Î´ALA) from the amino acid glycine and succinyl-CoA from the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle). The rate-limiting enzyme responsible for this reaction, ALA synthase, is strictly regulated by intracellular iron levels and heme concentration. A low-iron level, e.g., in iron deficiency, leads to decreased porphyrin synthesis, which prevents accumulation of the toxic intermediates. This mechanism is of therapeutic importance: infusion of heme arginate or hematin can abort attacks of porphyria in patients with an inborn error of metabolism of this process, by reducing transcription of ALA synthase.The organs mainly involved in heme synthesis are the liver and the bone marrow, although every cell requires heme to function properly. Heme is seen as an intermediate molecule in catabolism of haemoglobin in the process of bilirubin metabolism.Source: Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heme		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP61	Notch signaling pathway		The Notch pathway is an evolutionally conserved signaling pathway which plays an important role in diverse developmental and physiological processes. These include cell-fate determination, tissue patterning and morphogenesis, cell differentiation, proliferation and cell death. The Notch pathway is named after the Drosophila mutants that showed irregular notches of missing tissue at the insect wing blade tips. The Notch gene was cloned in 1985. Proteins of the Notch families are single-pass transmembrane proteins that function both as cell surface receptors and nuclear transcriptional regulators. Four Notch receptors (Notch 1-4) have been identified in mammals. Mature Notch receptors are non-covalent heterodimers consisting of an extracellular subunit (NEC) and a transmembrane subunit (NTM). NEC possess multiple EGF-like repeats and three specialized Lin-Notch repeats (LNR) that forms a tight hydrophobic interaction with extracellular stump of NTM. This region masks an A disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) cleavage site. The region where these two subunits interact is called the heterodimerization domain (HD). Notch ligands are also transmembrane proteins with multiple EGF-like repeats, a short cytoplasmic tail and a specialized delta-serrate-lag2 (DSL) domain at the N-terminus. There are five canonical Notch ligands i.e. Jagged (JAG1 and JAG2), Delta-like (DLL1, DLL3, DLL4) in mammals. Notch signaling activation occurs upon ligand-receptor binding, which are expressed on two adjacent cells. Ligand binding causes dissociation of NEC from NTM, unmasking the ADAM cleavage site. The NEC fragment is trans- endocytosed into the ligand expressing cells. The full-length receptor minus the NEC fragment is cleaved at the membrane by ADAM17 generating an intermediate, Notch extracellular truncation (NEXT). This is further cleaved by Î³-secretase that generates an active Notch intracellular fragment (NIC) or Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The Î³-secretase complex is composed of PSEN1, PSEN2, PSENEN, NCSTN and APH1 (A or B). Following these two cleavage steps, the NICD is released into the cytoplasm and translocates into the nucleus to regulate transcription of Notch target genes. Upon translocation into the nucleus, NICD binds to RBPJ which is a constitutive repressor of Notch signaling. RBPJ represses Notch target gene expression by recruiting a co-repressor complex, which includes NCOR1, NCOR2, SNW1, CIR, HDAC1, HDAC2, SPEN and FHL1 and SAP30. NICD binding to RBPJ replaces the co-repressor complex with a co-activator complex which includes MAML1-3, EP300 and SNW1. Primary Notch target genes include two families of transcriptional factors Hes, including HES1 and HES5 as well as Hey including HEY1 and HEY2. Other Notch target genes include CCND1, CDKN1A, GATA3 and PTCRA. CNTN1 acts as a functional ligand of Notch. This trans-extracellular interaction causes Î³-secretase-dependent nuclear translocation of the NICD. This signaling is involved in oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and upregulation of myelin-related protein MAG. In addition to the canonical Notch pathway, there is increasing evidence showing RBPJ independent non-canonical pathways. been fully characterized. Physical interaction of NOTCH-1IC with LCK- PI3K may mediate non-nuclear cross-talk with AKT, leading to survival signaling. Notch stimulation through AKT pathway leads to down regulation of MYC expression. Activation of SRC/STAT3 pathway by Notch signaling is dependent on the expression of Notch effector HES1 transcription factor. The induction of HES1 enhanced SRC phosphorylation. This activated SRC kinase was found to be responsible for the enhanced phosphorylation of STAT3. The HES1 and HES5 proteins associate with and facilitate the complex formation between JAK2 and STAT3, thus promoting STAT3 phosphorylation and activation. The activated STAT3 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and induces transcriptional activation of target gene expression (including HIF1A).Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/notch_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

ErbB-1 and ErbB-2 are found in many human cancers and their excessive signaling may be critical factors in the development and malignancy of these tumors.The ErbB protein family consists of 4 members* ErbB-1, also named epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)* ErbB-2, also named HER2 in humans and neu in rodents* ErbB-3, also named HER3 and* ErbB-4, also named HER4The four members of the ErbB protein family are capable of forming homodimers, heterodimers, and possibly higher order oligomers upon activation by a subset of potential growth factor ligands.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP678	Arachidonate epoxygenase / epoxide hydrolase		The cytochrome P450-dependent formation of polyunsaturated fatty acid epoxides is an important biochemical pathway creating mediators of inflammation and blood pressure regulation.  Once formed these compounds can be incorperated into phospholipid membrance, and released by the action of phospholipase A2.  The epoxides of arachidonic acid, i.e. the epoxyeicosatrieneoic acid or EETs, are putative endothelial derived hyperpolarization factors which increase the open state probability of Ca++ sensitive K+ channels, leading to vasodilation in arteriolar beds.  The 11(12)-EET in particular appears to have potent functions in vasodilation, and are inhibitors of NFKb dependent inflammatory signalling, and PAI-1 activity.  The 5(6)-EET appears unique, in that its metabolic transformation through cyclooxygenase activities produces potent vasoconstrictors.  With the exception of the 5(6)-EET, these epoxy fatty acids are good substrates for the soluble epoxide hydrolase.  Hydrolytic tranformation to vicinal diols eliminates vasoactive actions, however these vicinal diols have been reported to have other biological activites, including PPAR-alpha activation.  Recent development of inhibitors of the soluble epoxide hydrolase are proving to have potent anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, and anti-nociceptive properties.  Reports of enzyme catalyzed glutathione-conjugates of the epoxy fatty acids have been reported, but the activity and relavance of these potential metabolic products are unknown to date.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP688	Catalytic cycle of mammalian flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs)		Flavin-containing monooxygenases are a group of enzymes that catalyze the oxygenation of substrates, mostly soft nucleophiles via the cofactor flavin. In the catalytic cycle, FMO binds to NADPH and to FAD, causing the reduction of FAD to FADH2. Next, molecular oxygen binds to the complex and is reduced to a hydroperoxide form, called 4a-hydroperoxyflavin. This complex is stable in the absence of a substrate. When a substrate is present, the distal O-atom of the complex is transferred to the substrate yielding an oxygenated product and leaving the flavincomplex 4a-hydroxyflavin that breaks down releasing water. At the end of the cycle, NADP+ is released resulting in FAD as the flavin form to start a next cycle.  In contrast to cytochrome P450 enzymes, FMOs are generally not induced or inhibited by xenobiotic substances. The five human FMOs are tissue specific: FMO1 is present in the human fetal liver and the adult kidney, FMO2 is present in the lung and FMO3 is present in the adult liver.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP69	T-cell receptor signaling pathway		The T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) complex is composed of a ligand-binding subunit, the α and β chains, and a signaling subunit, namely the CD3ε, γ and δ chains and the TCRζ chain. This complex participates in T-cell activation upon the presentation of the antigen peptide (derived from the foreign antigen) bound to the MHC (Class I and Class II) residing on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells. Co-stimulatory receptors, such as CD2, CD28, CD4, CD8, and integrin molecules, contribute to signal transduction by modulating the response threshold. All the above components along with accessory proteins essential for MHC are a part of the immunological synapse that initiates T-cell activation.Protein tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by the Src family kinases Lck and Fyn, in turn regulated by CD45, is the initial event in TCR signaling. Lck is activated by the interaction of MHC and CD4 or CD8. It then induces the phosphorylation and activation of TCR-CD3 complex and eventually mediates Fyn activation. The activated Src kinases phosphorylate ITAMs (Immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs) present on CD3γ, δ, ε and ζ chain. The 70-kd ζ chain–associated protein kinase (ZAP70) is then recruited to the ITAMs followed by its phosphorylation and subsequent activation which results in further amplification of the response. These activated PTKs induce tyrosine phosphorylation of several polypeptides, including the transmembrane adaptor LAT (Linker Activator for T-Cells). Protein tyrosine phosphorylation subsequently leads to the activation of multiple pathways, including ERK (Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinase), JNK (c-Jun N-terminal Kinase), NF-κB (Nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1) and NFAT(Nuclear Factor of Activated T-Cells) pathways, which ultimately induce effector functions.CD28 ligation by B7-1 or B7-2 helps in bringing the T-Cell and Antigen Presenting Cell membranes into close proximity. This event also provides a co-stimulatory signal leading to the production of IL-2 and T- cell activation. Besides CD28, many other transmembrane receptors also modulate specific elements of TCR signaling. CD28 and CD45 activate Lck which in turn induces the phosphorylation and activation of the TCR-CD3 complex and consequently, the tyrosine kinases Fyn and ZAP70. CD45 plays a role in antagonizing the effect of inhibitory proteins on T-cell activation. ZAP70 induces activation of LAT (Linker for Activation of T-Cells), an integral membrane adaptor protein which further binds to GADS (Growth Factor Receptor-Bound Protein-2-Related Adaptor Protein-2), SLP76 (SH2 Domain-Containing Leukocyte Protein-76), and ITK (IL-2 inducible T-cell kinase). This complex facilitates the activation of PLCG1 (Phospholipase-C-Gamma1) that is responsible for the production of the second messengers DAG (Diacylglycerol) and IP3 (Inositol Triphosphate). DAG activates proteins including PKCθ (Protein Kinase-C-Theta) and Ras, whereas IP3 leads to Ca2+ release from ER and also facilitates influx of extracellular calcium. Increased intracellular Ca2+ activates the phosphatase Calcineurin that dephosphorylates NFAT which then enters the nucleus and promotes transcription.Activated LAT also binds multiple adaptor proteins including GRB2, GRAP (GRB2- Related Adaptor Protein) and GADS to facilitate activation of serine/threonine kinases such as Raf1, MEK (MAPK/ERK Kinase) and dual-specificity kinases ERK1/2 that are involved in activation of MAPKs (Mitogen activated protein kinases) resulting in the induction of transcription factor Elk1.ZAP70 also activates IKKs via the CARD11 (Caspase recruitment domain family, member 11) -BCL10 (B-Cell CLL/lymphoma-10)-MALT1 (Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma Translocation Gene-1) complex and MAP3K (activated by PKCθ) which in turn relieve NF-κB of IκB (NF-kappa-B inhibitor beta) and allow its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation. ZAP70 also activates p38 via Vav, Rac and MKK3/6 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase-3 / Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase-6). p38 then activates the transcription factor ATF2 (Activating Transcription Factor-2).  Activated Rac also activates JNK via MEKK1 and MKK4/7 (MKK4 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase-4/ Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase-7) which eventually leads to activation of c-Jun mediated transcription.SIT (SHP2-Interacting Transmembrane Adaptor Protein) and CTLA4 (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen-4) are transmembrane adaptor proteins that interact with the SHP2 (SH2-containing Protein tyrosine Phosphatase-2) and negatively regulate T-cell activation by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Fyn and CD28 respectively. CTLA4 has a greater affinity for its B7-1/B7-2ligands in comparison toCD28 and thus competes for them. During T-cell activation CTLA4 is endocytosed to quicken the response. ZAP70 facilitates translocation of CTLA4 to the membrane when the response needs to be controlled. PAG (Phosphoprotein Associated with Glycosphingolipid Microdomains), a transmembrane adaptor molecule is associated with CSK (c-Src Tyrosine Kinase), an inhibitor of Src-related protein tyrosine kinases. Overexpression of PAG inhibits TCR-mediated responses.  Dual specificity phosphatase 3 (DUSP3) or VHR is also induced by ZAP70 which consequently down regulates ERK activation and thus controls T-cell response.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/tcr_pathway.html NetSlim] database.		9606
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP690	Polyol pathway		When glucose is unused, it is metabolized via the polyol pathway. This pathway consists of two main enzymatic steps. First, glucose is reduced to sorbitol by aldose reductase. In this step, NADPH is oxidized to NADP+. The next step is the oxidation of sorbitol to D-fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase.Fructose can then be phosphorylated by fructokinase and subsequently be metabolized via dihydroxyacetone phosphate or glyceraldehyde to D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which can be used as a substrate in the process of glycolysis.The sorbitol pathway plays a role in diabetic renal complications because aldose reductase metabolizes the excess of glucose to toxic metabolites that induce hyperfiltration and glomerular dysfunction.		9606

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP706	Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) susceptibility pathways		In this model, we provide an integrated view of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) at the level of implicated tissues, signaling networks and genetics. The purpose of this model is to serve as an overview of research in this field and recommend new candidates for more focused or genome wide analyses. SIDS is the sudden and unexpected death of an infant (less than 1 year of age), almost always during deep sleep, where no cause of death can be found by autopsy. Factors that mediate SIDS are likely to be both biological and behavioral, such as sleeping position, environment and stress during a critical phase of infant development (http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/Sudden_Infant_Death_Syndrome.cfm). While no clear diagnostic markers currently exist, several polymorphisms have been identified which are significantly over-represented in distinct SIDS ethnic population. The large majority of these polymorphisms exist in genes associated with neuronal signaling, cardiac contraction and inflammatory response. These and other lines of evidence suggest that SIDS has a strong autonomic nervous system component (PMID:12350301, PMID: 20124538). One of the neuronal nuclei most strongly implicated in SIDS has been the raphe nucleus of the brain stem. In this nuclei there are ultrastructural, cellular and molecular changes associated with SIDS relative to controls (PMID:19342987, PMID: 20124538). This region of the brain is responsible for the large majority of neuronal serotonin produced and is functionally important in the regulation of normal cardiopulmonary activity, sleep and thermoregulation (see associated references).Genes associated with serotonin synthesis and receptivity have some of the strongest genetic association with SIDS. Principle among these genes the serotonin biosynthetic enzyme TPH2, the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 and the serotonin receptor HTR1A. SLC6A4 exhibits decreased expression in the raphe nucleus of the medulla oblongata and polymorphisms specifically associated with SIDS (PMID:19342987). In 75% of infants with SIDS, there is decreased HTR1A expression relative to controls along with an increase in the number of raphe serotonin neurons (PMID:19342987). Over-expression of the mouse orthologue of the HTR1A gene in the juvenile mouse medulla produces an analogous phenotype to SIDS with death due to bradycardia and hypothermia (PMID:18599790). These genes as well as those involved in serotonin synthesis are predicted to be transcriptionally regulated by a common factor, FEV (human orthologue of PET-1). PET-1 knock-out results in up to a 90% loss of serotonin neurons (PMID:12546819), while polymorphisms in FEV are over-represented in African American infants with SIDS. In addition to FEV, other transcription factors implicated in the regulation of these genes (Putative transcriptional regulators (TRs)) and FEV are also listed (see associated references). In addition to serotonin, vasopressin signaling and its regulation by serotonin appear to be important in a common pathway of cardiopulmonary regulation (PMID:2058745). A protein that associates with vasopressin signaling, named pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (ADCYAP1), results in a SIDS like phenotype, characterized by a high increase in spontaneous neonatal death, exacerbated by hypothermia and hypoxia (PMID:14608012), when disrupted in mice. Protein for this gene is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system (CNS), including autonomic control centers (PMID:12389210). ADCYAP1 and HTR1A are both predicted to be transcriptionally regulated by REST promoter binding. Regulation of G-protein coupled signaling pathways is illustrated for these genes, however, it is not clear whether ADCYAP1 acts directly upon raphe serotonin neurons. Another potentially important class of receptors in SIDS is nicotine. Receptors for nicotine are expressed in serotonin neurons of the raphe throughout development (PMID:18986852).  Application of nicotine or cigarette smoke is sufficient to inhibit electrical activity of raphe serotonin neurons (PMID:17515803) and chronic nicotine infusion in rats decreases expression of SLC6A4 (PMID:18778441). Furthermore, nicotine exposure reduces both HTR1A and HTR2A immunoreactivity in several nuclei of the brainstem (PMID:17451658).In addition to CNS abnormalities, several studies have identified a critical link between cardiac arrhythmia (long QT syndrome) and SIDS (PMID:18928334). A number of genetic association studies identified functionally modifying mutations in critical cardiac channels in as many as 10% of all SIDS cases (PMID:18928334). These mutations have been predicted to predispose infants for long QT syndrome and sudden death. The highest proportion of SIDS associated mutations (both inherited and sporadic) is found in the sodium channel gene SCN5A. Examination of putative transcriptional regulators for these genes, highlights a diverse set of factors as well as a relatively common one (SP1).Finally, several miscellaneous mutations have been identified in genes associated with inflammatory response and thermoregulation. Infection is considered a significant risk factor for SIDS (PMID:19114412). For inflammatory associated genes, such as TNF alpha, interleukin 10 and complement component 4, many of these mutations are only significant in the presence of infection and SIDS. In addition to these mutations, cerebrospinal fluid levels of IL6 are increased in SIDS cases as well as IL6R levels in the arcuate nucleus of the brain, another major site of serotonin synthesis (PMID:19396608). Genes such as ILR6 and ADCYAP1 are also associated with autoimmune disorders, thus SIDS may also be associated with autoinflammation of autonomic centers in the brain. Regulation of thermogenesis by brown adipose tissue has been proposed be an important component of SIDS, given that SIDS incidence is highest in the winter time and that animal models of SIDS demonstrate variation in body temperature. Interestingly, activation of raphe HTR1A decreases both shivering and peripheral vasoconstriction in piglets (18094064). Although a putative significant polymorphism was identified in the thermoregulator gene HSP60, this only occurred in one SIDS case. It is important to note that in the large majority of all these studies, sleeping position and smoking were among the most significant risk factors for SIDS.

It is also known to act on various cell types known to be involved in asthma including T cells, B cells, mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, and epithelial cells. IL-9 can promote the expression of TGF-beta in lipopolysaccharide-induced monocytes and macrophages. IL-9 is also known to play important roles in conditions including airway inflammation, EAE and parasitic infections. Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is activated transiently by IL-9, which in turn leads to the growth stimulation of hematopoietic cell lines. IL-9 signals through the heterodimeric receptor composed of a specific chain (IL-9R) and a gamma chain (IL2RG), which is shared between IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL15 and IL-21. The IL-9R and IL-2RG associates with JAK1 and JAK3 respectively. Receptor engagement results in JAK1- JAK3 cross phosphorylation and activation of the JAK proteins which leads to the activation of Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT-1, STAT-3 and STAT-5) and Insulin receptor substrate 1 and 2 (IRS1 and IRS2)/PI3K cascades. IL-9 stimulation also results in the activation of MEK/ERK signaling cascade.		10090

It is an essential structural component of mammalian cell membranes, where it is required to establish proper membrane permeability and fluidity. In addition, cholesterol is an important component for the manufacture of bile acids, steroid hormones, and several fat-soluble vitamins. Cholesterol is the principal sterol synthesized by animals, but small quantities are synthesized in other eukaryotes, such as plants and fungi.

In spite of the wide range of cellular processes that the TGF&amp;#x3b2; signaling pathway regulates, the process is relatively simple. TGF&amp;#x3b2; superfamily ligands bind to a type II receptor, which recruits and phosphorylates a type I receptor. The type I receptor then phosphorylates receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs) which can now bind the coSMAD SMAD4. R-SMAD/coSMAD complexes accumulate in the nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the regulation of target gene expression.

Binding of Hedgehog ligands to their receptors, Patched 1 and 2, prevents inhibition of a 7 transmembrane receptor called Smoothened. This leads to activation of GLI family of transcription factors (GLI1-3). Signaling through the Hedgehog pathway is essential for development of many tissues and organs. This pathway is highly conserved among metazoans. Aberrant activation of this pathway has been associated with a number of human malignancies including carcinoma of lung, esophagus, pancreas and prostate.Source: NetPath http://www.netpath.org/pathways?path_id=NetPath_10		10090
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1241	Glucuronidation		Metabolism of xenobiotic compounds consists of phase I and a phase II biotransformation reactions, being compound modification and conjugation reactions respectively. In phase I biotransformation, the compound is modificated via oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, or other minor reactions, to reveal a reactive group to which a conjugation molecule can react to. In phase II, a small conjugation molecule reacts with the phase I modified molecule, producing a much more water-soluble molecule that can be excreted more easily.Glucuronidation is a phase II biotransformation reaction in which glucuronide acts as a conjugation molecule and binds to a substrate via the catalysis of glucuronosyltransferases. First, in a series of reactions the cosubstrate uridine diphosphate glucuronic acid (UDPGA) is formed. The glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) then catalyze the transfer of glucuronic acid from UDPGA to a substrate resulting in a glucuronidated substrate and leaving uridine 5'-diphosphate. UGTs are a very broad and divers group of enzymes and count as the most significant  group of conjugation enzymes in xenobiotic metabolism, qualitatively because glucuronic acid can be coupled to a large diversity of functional groups and quantitatively because of the large and divers number of substrates that are formed.		10090

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1250	Arachidonate epoxygenase / epoxide hydrolase		The cytochrome P450-dependent formation of polyunsaturated fatty acid epoxides is an important biochemical pathway creating mediators of inflammation and blood pressure regulation.  Once formed these compounds can be incorperated into phospholipid membrance, and released by the action of phospholipase A2.  The epoxides of arachidonic acid, i.e. the epoxyeicosatrieneoic acid or EETs, are putative endothelial derived hyperpolarization factors which increase the open state probability of Ca++ sensitive K+ channels, leading to vasodilation in arteriolar beds.  The 11(12)-EET in particular appears to have potent functions in vasodilation, and are inhibitors of NFKb dependent inflammatory signalling, and PAI-1 activity.  The 5(6)-EET appears unique, in that its metabolic transformation through cyclooxygenase activities produces potent vasoconstrictors.  With the exception of the 5(6)-EET, these epoxy fatty acids are good substrates for the soluble epoxide hydrolase.  Hydrolytic tranformation to vicinal diols eliminates vasoactive actions, however these vicinal diols have been reported to have other biological activites, including PPAR-alpha activation.  Recent development of inhibitors of the soluble epoxide hydrolase are proving to have potent anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, and anti-nociceptive properties.  Reports of enzyme catalyzed glutathione-conjugates of the epoxy fatty acids have been reported, but the activity and relavance of these potential metabolic products are unknown to date.		10090

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1265	Polyol pathway		When glucose is unused, it is metabolized via the polyol pathway. This pathway consists of two main enzymatic steps.

The next step is the oxidation of sorbitol to D-fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase.Fructose can then be phosphorylated by fructokinase and subsequently be metabolized via dihydroxyacetone phosphate or glyceraldehyde to D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which can be used as a substrate in the process of glycolysis.The sorbitol pathway plays a role in diabetic renal complications because aldose reductase metabolizes the excess of glucose to toxic metabolites that induce hyperfiltration and glomerular dysfunction.		10090
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1266	SIDS susceptibility pathways		In this model, we provide an integrated view of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) at the level of implicated tissues, signaling networks and genetics. The purpose of this model is to serve as an overview of research in this field and recommend new candidates for more focused or genome wide analyses. SIDS is the sudden and unexpected death of an infant (less than 1 year of age), almost always during deep sleep, where no cause of death can be found by autopsy. Factors that mediate SIDS are likely to be both biological and behavioral, such as sleeping position, environment and stress during a critical phase of infant development (http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/Sudden_Infant_Death_Syndrome.cfm). While no clear diagnostic markers currently exist, several polymorphisms have been identified which are significantly over-represented in distinct SIDS ethnic population. The large majority of these polymorphisms exist in genes associated with neuronal signaling, cardiac contraction and inflammatory response. These and other lines of evidence suggest that SIDS has a strong autonomic nervous system component (PMID:12350301). One of the neuronal nuclei most strongly implicated in SIDS has been the raphe nucleus of the brain stem. In this nuclei there are ultrastructural, cellular and molecular changes associated with SIDS relative to controls (PMID:19342987). This region of the brain is responsible for the large majority of serotonin that is produced in the human body and is functionally important in the regulation of normal cardiopulmonary activity, sleep and thermoregulation (see associated references).Genes associated with serotonin synthesis and receptivity have some of the strongest genetic association with SIDS. Principle among these genes is the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 and the serotonin receptor HTR1A. SLC6A4 exhibits decreased expression in the raphe nucleus of the medulla oblongata and polymorphisms specifically associated with SIDS (PMID:19342987). In 75% of infants with SIDS, there is decreased HTR1A expression relative to controls along with an increase in the number of raphe serotonin neurons (PMID:19342987). Over-expression of the mouse orthologue of the HTR1A gene in the juvenile mouse medulla produces an analogous phenotype to SIDS with death due to bradycardia and hypothermia (PMID:18599790). These genes as well as those involved in serotonin synthesis are predicted to be transcriptionally regulated by a common factor, FEV (human orthologue of PET-1). PET-1 knock-out results in up to a 90% loss of serotonin neurons (PMID:12546819), while polymorphisms in FEV are over-represented in African American infants with SIDS. In addition to FEV, other transcription factors implicated in the regulation of these genes (Putative transcriptional regulators (TRs)) and FEV are also listed (see associated references). In addition to serotonin, vasopressin signaling and its regulation by serotonin appear to be important in a common pathway of cardiopulmonary regulation (PMID:2058745). A protein that associates with vasopressin signaling, named pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (ADCYAP1), results in a SIDS like phenotype, characterized by a high increase in spontaneous neonatal death, exacerbated by hypothermia and hypoxia (PMID:14608012), when disrupted in mice. Protein for this gene is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system (CNS), including autonomic control centers (PMID:12389210). ADCYAP1 and HTR1A are both predicted to be transcriptionally regulated by REST promoter binding. Regulation of G-protein coupled signaling pathways is illustrated for these genes, however, it is not clear whether ADCYAP1 acts directly upon raphe serotonin neurons. Another potentially important class of receptors in SIDS is nicotine. Receptors for nicotine are expressed in serotonin neurons of the raphe throughout development (PMID:18986852).  Application of nicotine or cigarette smoke is sufficient to inhibit electrical activity of raphe serotonin neurons (PMID:17515803) and chronic nicotine infusion in rats decreases expression of SLC6A4 (PMID:18778441). Furthermore, nicotine exposure reduces both HTR1A and HTR2A immunoreactivity in several nuclei of the brainstem (PMID:17451658).In addition to CNS abnormalities, several studies have identified a critical link between cardiac arrhythmia (long QT syndrome) and SIDS (PMID:18928334). A number of genetic association studies identified functionally modifying mutations in critical cardiac channels in as many as 10% of all SIDS cases (PMID:18928334). These mutations have been predicted to predispose infants for long QT syndrome and sudden death. The highest proportion of SIDS associated mutations (both inherited and sporadic) is found in the sodium channel gene SCN5A. Examination of putative transcriptional regulators for these genes, highlights a diverse set of factors as well as a relatively common one (SP1).Finally, several miscellaneous mutations have been identified in genes associated with inflammatory response and thermoregulation. Infection is considered a significant risk factor for SIDS (PMID:19114412). For inflammatory associated genes, such as TNF alpha, interleukin 10 and complement component 4, many of these mutations are only significant in the presence of infection and SIDS. In addition to these mutations, cerebrospinal fluid levels of IL6 are increased in SIDS cases as well as IL6R levels in the arcuate nucleus of the brain, another major site of serotonin synthesis (PMID:19396608). Genes such as ILR6 and ADCYAP1 are also associated with autoimmune disorders, thus SIDS may also be associated with autoinflammation of autonomic centers in the brain. Regulation of thermogenesis by brown adipose tissue has been proposed be an important component of SIDS, given that SIDS incidence is highest in the winter time and that animal models of SIDS demonstrate variation in body temperature. Interestingly, activation of raphe HTR1A decreases both shivering and peripheral vasoconstriction in piglets (18094064). Although a putative significant polymorphism was identified in the thermoregulator gene HSP60, this only occurred in one SIDS case. It is important to note that in the large majority of all these studies, sleeping position and smoking were among the most significant risk factors for SIDS.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP18	Heme biosynthesis		The enzymatic process that produces heme is properly called porphyrin synthesis, as all the intermediates are tetrapyrroles that are chemically classified are porphyrins. The process is highly conserved across biology. In humans, this pathway serves almost exclusively to form heme. In other species, it also produces similar substances such as cobalamin (vitamin B12).The pathway is initiated by the synthesis of D-Aminolevulinic acid (dALA or Î´ALA) from the amino acid glycine and succinyl-CoA from the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle). The rate-limiting enzyme responsible for this reaction, ALA synthase, is strictly regulated by intracellular iron levels and heme concentration. A low-iron level, e.g., in iron deficiency, leads to decreased porphyrin synthesis, which prevents accumulation of the toxic intermediates. This mechanism is of therapeutic importance: infusion of heme arginate or hematin can abort attacks of porphyria in patients with an inborn error of metabolism of this process, by reducing transcription of ALA synthase.The organs mainly involved in heme synthesis are the liver and the bone marrow, although every cell requires heme to function properly. Heme is seen as an intermediate molecule in catabolism of haemoglobin in the process of bilirubin metabolism.Source: Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heme		10090

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2081	SRF and miRs in Smooth Muscle Differentiation and Proliferation		Smooth muscle cells exhibit a unique plasticity, in that they are able to oscillate between proliferative and more quiescent, differentiated states. These two states are determined, in part, by a network of transcription factors, including Klf-4, Elk-1 and serum response factor (SRF), that regulate expression of genes controlling smooth muscle cell status. Two smooth muscle-enriched, co-transcribed microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-143 and miR-145, cooperatively target this transcription factor network to promote smooth muscle cell differentiation. miR-145 also acts in a positive feed-foward regulatory loop to enhance expression of the smooth muscle regulator, Myocardin (Myocd), which cooperates with SRF to activate transcription of miR-143/145. Conversely, the cardiac and skeletal muscle-enriched miRNA, miR-133, which is also under transcriptional control of both SRF and Mef2C, acts in a negative feed-back loop to decrease SRF translation. Other miRNAs, including miR-214 and miR-199a, also target SRF, limiting its activity in specific cell types.		10090

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2083	Nicotine activity on dopaminergic neurons		Nicotine is an alkaloid found in tobacco plants. It is a substance that acts as a stimulant in humans and is one of the main factors responsible for tobacco dependence. When nicotine enters the body, it is distributed quickly through the bloodstream, and it can cross the blood-brain barrier to enter the central nervous system (CNS). It binds to two main types of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: the ganglion type and the CNS type.In dopaminergic neurons in the CNS, nicotine binds to the CNS-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The main type of CNS receptor is composed of alpha 4 beta 2 (CHRNA4, CHRNB2) subunits. It has been shown that alpha 6, alpha 5, and beta 3 can also be in the receptor complex to modulate binding sensitivity. By binding to the receptor, nicotine causes cell depolarization and release of dopamine from the cell through the SNARE complex. Dopamine then binds to dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) on dopaminergic terminals and activates Gi alpha (GNAI1), initiating a feedback loop to inhibit dopamine release. One of the key players mediating dopamine signaling is PPP1R1B (also called DARPP-32, dopamine and cyclic AMP-regulated phospho-protein). PPP1R1B is a bifunctional signal transduction molecule which, by distinct mechanisms, inhibits either a serine/threonine kinase (PPKACA or PKA) or a serine/threonine phosphatase (PPP1CA or protein phosphatase 1). When PPP1R1B is phosphorylated by PPKACA at threonine 34, it is an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PPP1CA), which inhibits dopamine secretion through the SNARE complex. When PPP1R1B is phosphorylated by CDK5 at threonine 75, it is converted to an inhibitor of PPKACA. Binding of dopamine to D2-like dopamine receptors leads to inhibition of adenylate cyclase (ADCY2) via G-protein GNAI1, and decreases PKA-stimulated phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr34. This, in turn, relieves the inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 (PPP1CA), and inhibits further dopamine release.Sources: [http://www.pharmgkb.org/do/serve?objId=PA162355621&objCls=Pathway PharmGKB:Nicotine in Dopaminergic Neurons], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine Wikipedia:Nicotine]		10090

Chemokines are small chemoattractant peptides that provide directional cues for the cell trafficking and thus are vital for protective host response. In addition, chemokines regulate plethora of biological processes of hematopoietic cells to lead cellular activation, differentiation and survival.The chemokine signal is transduced by chemokine receptors (G-protein coupled receptors) expressed on the immune cells. After receptor activation, the alpha- and beta-gamma-subunits of G protein dissociate to activate diverse downstream pathways resulting in cellular polarization and actin reorganization. Various members of small GTPases are involved in this process. Induction of nitric oxide and production of reactive oxygen species are as well regulated by chemokine signal via calcium mobilization and diacylglycerol production.Source: [http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway:map04062 KEGG]		10090

Spinal cord injury is a complex multi-step process that involves the regulation of gene expression and signaling in motor neurons, oligodentrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes that trigger immediate immune responses lasting several weeks. Within 24 hours, chemoattractants  and cytokines released from the site of injury activate neutrophils which further recruit B and T cells or recruit monocytes that ultimately result in infiltration and activation by microglia and macrophages. These immune responses result in inflammation, excitotoxicity, cell death, formation of glial scar, and suppression of axonal regeneration. An increase in the expression of cell cycle genes further results in proliferation of astrocytes and microglia that leads to apoptosis and necrosis of oligodentrocytes and neurons.		10090

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2573	Primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)		"Primary or idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) a cause of nephrotic syndrome in children and adolescents, as well as an important cause of end stage renal disease in adults. FSGS is mainly associated with foot process effacement, proliferation of mesangial, endothelial and epithelial cells in the early stages followed by collapse of glomerular capillaries leading to scarring. It may lead to dramatic manifestations such as proteinuria, hypoaluminemia, and hypertension. Also, there are many inheritable genetic abnormalities that can cause podocyte damage of FSGS caused by mutations in proteins that are important for podocyte function. The genes include CD2AP, MYO1E, WNT1, and LAMB2.On the far left, the diagram illustrates molecular interactions between a normal podocyte and matrix interactions. ACTN4 and SYNPO and DAG1 interacting with AGRN associate with the actin cytoskeleton; these actin associated proteins might play a role in maintaining podocyte and GBM architecture. DAG1 binds to UTRN, which in turn binds an actin filament, thus completing the link between the actin-based cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. Podocyte foot processes are anchored to the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) via ITGB1 and ITGA3 integrin complex and DAG1-UTRN complex. Transmembrane proteins such as LAMA5 and CD151 bind to ITGB1 and ITGA3, respectively. The intracellular integrins combine with cytoskeletal via intermediates which include TLN1, VCL, and PAX complex and the ILK, PARVA, and LIMS1 complex. (Guanghua Hu et. al 2013 - Biomedicine and Aging Pathology vol 3)Upon primary podocyte injury, there are multiple pathways involved in podocyte injury. ""Sustaining NPHS1 and phosphorylation might contribute to both anti-apoptotic signaling and actin polymerization. The CD80 pathway may be targeted by TLR4 or blocking the binding of B7-1 to slit diaphragm structure proteins such as KIRREL2/3. PLAUR could be inhibited by interfering with binding of PLAUR and ITGAV/B3 integrin, inhibiting ITGB3 integrin activation, or inhibiting binding of ITGAV/B3 integrin to VTN. The notch pathway can be targeted by interfering with its upstream activation by blocking the TGF-Î²1 effect, inhibiting Î³-secretase, which is required for proteolytic receptor activation, or interfering with target gene transcription."" (Reiser J. et al 2010 - Kidney Int vol 77) Post podocyte development, increased activation of NOTCH1 and WNT/CTNNB1 activities contribute to glomerulosclerosis. Expression of JAG1 on the ligand-expressing cell induces proteolytic cleavage of the Notch receptor on the signal-receiving cell, releasing the NOTCH1. DKK1 inhibits WNT1 binding to LRP5/6. By inhibiting the destruction of CTNNB1, CTNNB1 is stablilized. ""The CTSL pathway could be targeted by specifically inhibiting CTSL expression or activity, shifting the equilibrium of SYNPO toward the phosphorylated form by inhibiting calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation or enhancing PKA or CAMK2B-mediated phosphorylation, protecting SYNPO and DNM1 by compounds that bind to the CTSL cleavage site, or delivering cleavage-resistant SYNPO and DNM1 mutants."" (Reiser J. et al 2010 - Kidney Int vol 77)The destruction of podocyte's cytoskeleton architecture leads to lose of normal podocyte epitopes such as VIM, SYNPO, and WT1, and lose of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors CDKN1C and CDKN1B. Also, podocytes acquire proliferation of CDKN1A. This leads to podocytopenia which have been shown to cause primary FSGS and then followed by end-stage renal disease (ESRD). FSGS is also induced by microRNA-193a and its downregulation of WT1, destroying podocyte foot processes.There is insufficient evidence that segmental glomerular lesions can be caused by other drugs or toxins, apart from some used experimentally such as doxorubicin and puromycin aminonucleoside. Treatments such as steroids, high-dose cyclosporine, ritxuximab can reduce proteinuria based on their immunosuppressive properties and through stabilization of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton."		10090

Signaling through the Notch receptors is triggered by ligand-binding that induces cleavage of the extracellular domain by an ADAM family metalloprotease followed by a cleavage within the transmembrane domain by gamma secretase complex. The second cleavage leads to translocation of the cytosolic domain of Notch receptors into the nucleus. Notch proteins are important in lineage specification and stem cell maintenance.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP2841	Focal adhesion: PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway		Cell-matrix adhesions play essential roles in important biological processes including cell motility, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, regulation of gene expression and cell survival. At the cell-extracellular matrix contact points, specialized structures are formed and termed focal adhesions, where bundles of actin filaments are anchored to transmembrane receptors of the integrin family through a multi-molecular complex of junctional plaque proteins. Some of the constituents of focal adhesions participate in the structural link between membrane receptors and the actin cytoskeleton, while others are signalling molecules, including different protein kinases and phosphatases, their substrates, and various adapter proteins. Integrin signaling is dependent upon the non-receptor tyrosine kinase activities of the FAK and src proteins as well as the adaptor protein functions of FAK, src and Shc to initiate downstream signaling events. These signalling events culminate in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton; a prerequisite for changes in cell shape and motility, and gene expression. Similar morphological alterations and modulation of gene expression are initiated by the binding of growth factors to their respective receptors, emphasizing the considerable crosstalk between adhesion- and growth factor-mediated signalling.Source: KEGGhttp://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?org_name=mmu&mapno=04151http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?org_name=mmu&mapno=04150http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?org_name=mmu&mapno=04152		10090

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP29	Notch signaling pathway		The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved, intercellular signaling mechanism essential for proper embryonic development in all metazoan organisms in the Animal kingdom. The Notch proteins (Notch1-Notch4 in vertebrates) are single-pass receptors that are activated by the Delta (or Delta-like) and Jagged/Serrate families of membrane-bound ligands. They are transported to the plasma membrane as cleaved, but otherwise intact polypeptides. Interaction with ligand leads to two additional proteolytic cleavages that liberate the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the plasma membrane. The NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with the DNA binding protein CSL, displacing a histone deacetylase (HDAc)-co-repressor (CoR) complex from CSL. Components of an activation complex, such as MAML1 and histone acetyltransferases (HATs), are recruited to the NICD-CSL complex, leading to the transcriptional activation of Notch target genes.		10090

Mutations impairing the proper function of Mecp2 are mainly associated with the Rett syndrome but may also contribute to other neurological disorders like schizophrenia, FASD (fetal alcohol syndrome), PPM-X-syndrome, autism, Prader-Will-syndrome, and Angelman-syndrome. Dependant on the cofactors Mecp2 acts as an activator or repressor of transcription and micro RNA production. It affects RNA splicing and regulates chromatin structure together with HP1 and interferes in methylation of DNA (epigenetics). The expression of Mecp2 itself is highly regulated by promotor elements, cis-regulatory elements, polyadenylation, promotor DNA methylation and miRNA.

The pre-mRNA molecule undergoes three main modifications. These modifications are 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and RNA splicing, which occur in the cell nucleus before the RNA is translated.5' Capping: Capping of the pre-mRNA involves the addition of 7-methylguanosine (m7G) to the 5' end. The cap protects the 5' end of the primary RNA transcript from attack by ribonucleases that have specificity to the 3'5' phosphodiester bonds.3' Processing: The pre-mRNA processing at the 3' end of the RNA molecule involves cleavage of its 3' end and then the addition of about 200 adenine residues to form a poly(A) tail. As the poly(A) tails is synthesised, it binds multiple copies of poly(A) binding protein, which protects the 3'end from ribonuclease digestion.Splicing: RNA splicing is the process by which introns, regions of RNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule.Description adapted from Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-transcriptional_modification		10090
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP317	Glycogen metabolism		"Glycogen is a very large, branched polymer of glucose residues. Within skeletal muscle and liver glucose is stored as glycogen. In the liver, glycogen synthesis and degradation are regulated to maintain blood-glucose levels as required to meet the needs of the organism as a whole. In contrast, in muscle, these processes are regulated to meet the energy needs of the muscle itself. '''Glycogen synthesis''' is, unlike its breakdown, endergonic. This means that glycogen synthesis requires the input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from UTP, which reacts with glucose-1-phosphate, forming UDP-glucose, in reaction catalyzed by UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDP-glucose by the enzyme glycogen synthase, which progressively lengthens the glycogen chain with (a1->4) bonded glucose. As glycogen synthase can only lengthen an existing chain, the protein glycogenin is needed to initiate the synthesis of glycogen. The glycogen-branching enzyme, amylo (a1->4) to (a1->6) transglycosylase, catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of 6-7 glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.'''Glycogen degradation''' consists of three steps: (1) the release of glucose 1-phosphate from glycogen, (2) the remodeling of the glycogen substrate to permit further degradation, and (3) the conversion of glucose 1-phosphate into glucose 6-phosphate for further metabolism.Information partly derived from ""Biochemistry"" by Stryer and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen Wikipedia]."		10090

Gene transcription from NF-κB activity results in the production of inflammatory mediators, including proatherogenic cytokines. It also results in the production of primary miR-146a (pri-miR-146a) that is subsequently processed into mature miR-146a that silences the expression of key TLR-adaptor molecules interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). The production of miR-146a thereby serves as a regulatory feedback loop to suppress NF-κB activity and resolve inflammation. Findings from our study identified that cellular apoE expression contributes to amplify this regulatory feedback loop by increasing PU.1-dependent transcription of pri-miR-146a and thereby mature miR-146a production.		10090

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3638	Parkinson's disease		Most people with Parkinson's disease have idiopathic Parkinson's disease (having no specific known cause). A small proportion of cases, however, can be attributed to known genetic factors. Mutations in specific genes have been conclusively shown to cause PD. These genes code for alpha-synuclein (SNCA), parkin (PRKN), leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2 or dardarin), PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), DJ-1 and ATP13A2.[4][22] In most cases, people with these mutations will develop PD. With the exception of LRRK2, however, they account for only a small minority of cases of PD.[4] The most extensively studied PD-related genes are SNCA and LRRK2. Mutations in genes including SNCA, LRRK2 and glucocerebrosidase (GBA) have been found to be risk factors for sporadic PD. The role of the SNCA gene is important in PD because the alpha-synuclein protein is the main component of Lewy bodies.[22] Missense mutations of the gene (in which a single nucleotide is changed), and duplications and triplications of the locus containing it have been found in different groups with familial PD. Mutations in LRRK2 are the most common known cause of familial and sporadic PD, accounting for approximately 5% of individuals with a family history of the disease and 3% of sporadic cases.This is an updated copy of the human parkinson disease pathway (WP2371).Sources: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease wikipedia], [https://www.qiagen.com/geneglobe/pathwayview.aspx?pathwayID=345 Quigen], and [http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/hsa/hsa05012.html KEGG].		10090

The second pathway begins with Fgfr2 activating Bmp4, a protein that may also be regulated by Shh, and continuing through a protein chain to regulate conjunctival cell fate. In this pathway Bmp also inhibits transdifferentiation of Meibomian Gland into a hair follicle, conjunctiva proliferation, and precocious differentiation.

The muscle of the uterus, responsible for contractile activity is the myometrium. Genes in this pathway are either transcribed in myometrial muscle cells or act upon the myometrium to regulate contraction. The left half of this pathway illustrates pathways of myometrial relaxation that are active throughout normal gestation. These signaling events act to suppress coordinated contractions to prevent the early onset of labor at term, largely via activation of the adenylyl-cyclase thrhough G-protein coupled receptors. On the right side of this pathway are signaling componets involved in the activation of uterine contractions at labor, in particular, activation of calcium mobilization via Oxytocin mediated binding to the Oxytocin G-protein coupled receptor. Additional genes implicated in this pathway, based on microarray expression profiling of gestation, term and postpartum of term mice are also included (e.g., Guca2b, Rdc1, Edg2) have also been included.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP403	Wnt signaling pathway		Wnt proteins are secreted morphogens that are required for basic developmental processes, such as cell-fate specification, progenitor-cell proliferation and the control of asymmetric cell division, in many different species and organs. There are at least three different Wnt pathways: the canonical pathway, the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway and the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway. In the canonical Wnt pathway, the major effect of Wnt ligand binding to its receptor is the stabilization of cytoplasmic beta-catenin through inhibition of the bea-catenin degradation complex. Beta-catenin is then free to enter the nucleus and activate Wnt-regulated genes through its interaction with TCF (T-cell factor) family transcription factors and concomitant recruitment of coactivators. Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling leads to the activation of the small GTPases RHOA (RAS homologue gene-family member A) and RAC1, which activate the stress kinase JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase) and ROCK (RHO-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1) and leads to remodelling of the cytoskeleton and changes in cell adhesion and motility. WNT-Ca2+ signalling is mediated through G proteins and phospholipases and leads to transient increases in cytoplasmic free calcium that subsequently activate the kinase PKC (protein kinase C) and CAMKII (calcium calmodulin mediated kinase II) and the phosphatase calcineurin.Source: [http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/hsa/hsa04310.html KEGG].		10090

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP431	Nuclear receptors in lipid metabolism and toxicity		Nuclear receptors are transcription factors that are activated upon binding to its ligands. Initially, they had been classified as classic endocrine nuclear hormone receptors and orphan receptors. However, further studies have led to the identification of lipid ligands for some of these adopted orphan receptors, which are responsible for lipid metabolism, storage or elimination. One of the characteristics of these receptors is that they act by forming heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR). The receptors include peroxisome proliferators-Activated receptors (PPARs) for fatty acids, liver X receptor (LCR) for oxysterols, Farnesoid X receptors (FXR) for bile acids and steroid xenobiotic receptor/X receptor (SXR/PXR or Nsil2) for xenobiotics. Other orphan receptors also require RXR for its functions are vitamin D receptor (VDR) for vitamin D and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) for retinoid acids, although these receptors are not involved in lipid metabolism. Upon binding to various ligands, three classes of proteins are synthesized including lipid binding proteins, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and cytochrome P450 member proteins which catalyzes lipid anabolism, metabolism and elimination.In addition to lipid metabolism, some members of the cytochrome P450 family genes are responsible for activation of procarcinogens, detoxification of environmental toxins and metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics. In particular, CAR, Nsil2 and recently identified VDR are important in up-regulation of these cytochromes. Of all the human cytochrome P450 genes, only a few CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 account for most toxicity effects, specifically CYP3A is responsible for clearing approximately half of the clinically prescribed drugs. For instance, acetaminophen, one of the most commonly used drug, is toxic in high doses due to the activation of CAR and the drugs subsequent conversion to acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) by CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and CYP3A.		10090

Folate is the primary methyl-group donor for processes such as DNA methylation reactions, nucleotide synthesis and DNA repair mechanisms. An important pathway for any study related to folate or DNA methylation.Differential methylation (e.g. hypermethylation of tumor suppressors) as well as disturbances in nucleotide synthesis and repair, are associated with several forms of cancer.

In this way phosphorylated Stathmin indirectly promotes polymerization. PDGFRα dephosphorylates STMN1, which leads to increased tubulin depolymerization. Vinblastine inhibits polymerization, effectively resulting in depolymerization.

The MMPs belong to a larger family of proteases known as the metzincin superfamily.Collectively they are capable of degrading all kinds of extracellular matrix proteins, but also can process a number of bioactive molecules. They are known to be involved in the cleavage of cell surface receptors, the release of apoptotic ligands (such as the FAS ligand), and chemokine/cytokine in/activation. MMPs are also thought to play a major role on cell behaviors such as cell proliferation, migration (adhesion/dispersion), differentiation, angiogenesis, apoptosis and host defense.Source: [[wikipedia:Matrix_metalloproteinase|Wikipedia]]		10090
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4466	Oxidative stress and redox pathway		This pathway represents biology relevant to glutathione, including biosynthesis, metabolism, redox cycle, uptake, glutathionylation and acivicin inhibition. Glutathione is an antioxidant that is synthesized in eukaryotes from L-cysteine, L-glutamic acid, and glycine in a two-step process involving gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione synthetase. Glutathione prevents cellular damage by acting as an electron donor to neutralize reactive oxygen species. Reactive glutathione is produced, which then reacts with another reactive glutathione molecule to produce glutathione disulfide, GSSG.It was based partly on [[Pathway:WP164 |WP164]] and [[Pathway:WP1770|WP1770]], with information added from literature.This pathway was created as a part of [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-020-0654-0 Mendiola et cl], pictured in fig 5.		10090

Mechanistically, cardiac macrophages produce more IL-10 leading to autocrine activation toward a fibrogenic phenotype. A profibrotic macrophage subset secretes more Spp1 (OPN) and fewer proteases and MMPs, contributing to fibroblast activation, collagen deposition, and subsequently increased myocardial stiffness and diastolic dysfunction.

The n-6 and 3 series can only be obtained from precursors in food.The elongation steps (addition of carbohydrates, increasing length of tail) are carried out by several Elovl-proteins.The desaturation (removal of hydrogens, creating double bonds within the tail) are possible by SCDs and Fads (where is position of the double bound addition is indicated after delta, counting from the COOH side).		10090
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP450	IL-2 signaling pathway		IL-2 is a multifunctional cytokine with pleiotropic effects on several cells of the immune system. IL-2 was originally discovered as a T cell growth factor, but it was also found to have actions related to B cell proliferation, and cytolytic activity of natural killer cells. IL-2 also activates lymphokine activated killer cells. In contrast to its proliferative effects, IL-2 also has potent activity in a process known as activation-induced cell death. More recently, IL-2 was shown to promote tolerance through its effects on regulatory T cell development. IL-2 clinically has anti-cancer effects as well as utility in supporting T cell numbers in HIV/AIDS. There are three classes of IL-2 receptors, binding IL-2 with low, intermediate, or high-affinity. The low affinity receptor (IL-2Rα alone) is not functional; signaling by IL-2 involves either the high affinity hetero-trimeric receptor containing IL-2Rα, IL-2Rβ and the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (originally named IL-2Rγ and now generally denoted as γc) or the intermediate affinity heterodimeric receptor composed of IL-2Rβ and γc. IL-2 stimulation induces the activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK3, which associate with IL-2Rβ and γc, respectively. These kinases in turn phosphorylate IL-2Rβ and induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) and various other downstream targets. The downstream signaling pathways activated by IL-2 also involves mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling modules, leading to both mitogenic and anti-apoptotic signals.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_2_pathway.html NetSlim] database.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP475	Irinotecan pathway		This pathway shows the biotransformation of the chemotherapy prodrug irinotecan to form the active metabolite SN-38, an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. SN-38 is primarily metabolized to the inactive SN-38 glucuronide by UGT1A1, the isoform catalyzing bilirubin glucuronidation. Irinotecan is used in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, small cell lung cancer and several other solid tumors. There is large interpatient variability in response to irinotecan, as well as severe side effects such as diarrhea and neutropenia, which might be explained in part by genetic variation in the metabolic enzymes and transporters depicted here. Well-known variants to effect this pathway are the promoter polymorphic repeat in UGT1A1 (UGT1A1*28) and the 1236C&amp;gt;T polymorphism in ABCB1. While UGT1A1*28 genotype has been associated with toxicity, further evidence is needed to describe the roles of ABCB1 variants in toxicity.Source: [http://www.pharmgkb.org/search/pathway/irinotecan/liver.jsp PharmGkb]		10090
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP4763	Regulation of Pgc1a expression by a Gsk3b-Tfeb signaling axis in skeletal muscle		In (skeletal) muscle cells, PGC-1 signaling controls mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative substrate metabolism. PGC-1 signaling disturbance in skeletal muscle is linked to several chronic diseases. This pathway depicts the mechanism in which inhibition of GSK-3β increases Pgc-1α abundance, through dephosphorylation of Tfeb [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamcr.2019.118610 Theeuwes et al, 2019]. This reaction allows Tfeb to translocate to the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the PPARGC1A gene to the Pgc-1α protein. Phosphorylation of Tfeb leads to binding with members of the 14-3-3 protein family, which disables transport into the nucleus. If the dephosphorylation of Tfeb through Gsk-3β is a direct or indirect reaction is as of yet unknown.		10090

Upon activation, the receptor is phosphorylated and associates with adaptor molecules Shc and Grb2, which then activate the PI 3-kinase/Akt, MAPK/NFkB and SMAD signaling modules.Source: NetPath http://www.netpath.org/pathways?path_id=NetPath_1		10090
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP493	Mapk signaling pathway		The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a highly conserved module that is involved in various cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. Mammals express at least four distinctly regulated groups of MAPKs, extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK)-1/2, Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK1/2/3), p38 proteins (p38alpha/beta/gamma/delta) and ERK5, that are activated by specific MAPKKs: MEK1/2 for ERK1/2, MKK3/6 for the p38, MKK4/7 (JNKK1/2) for the JNKs, and MEK5 for ERK5. Each MAPKK, however, can be activated by more than one MAPKKK, increasing the complexity and diversity of MAPK signalling. Presumably each MAPKKK confers responsiveness to distinct stimuli. For example, activation of ERK1/2 by growth factors depends on the MAPKKK c-Raf, but other MAPKKKs may activate ERK1/2 in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli.Source: KEGG http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway:map04010		10090

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5051	Na/K-ATPase/Src signaling		"The Na/K-ATPase, or Na+ pump, is a member of the P-type ATPase superfamily. In addition to pumping ions, Na/K-ATPase is engaged in assembly of multiple protein complexes that transmit signals to different intracellular compartments. The signaling function of the enzyme appears to have been acquired through the evolutionary incorporation of many specific binding motifs that interact with proteins and ligands. In some cell types the signaling Na/K-ATPase and its protein partners are compartmentalized in caveolae. Na/K-ATPase can bind with Src kinase and keep it inactive. However, binding of ouabain or other digitalis compound to Na/K-ATPase activates the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Src, resulting in the formation of an active ""binary receptor"" that phosphorylates and assembles other proteins into different signaling modules. This in turn activates multiple protein kinase cascades including mitogen-activated protein kinases and protein kinase C isozymes in a cell-specific manner. It also increases mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)and regulates intracellular calcium concentration. Crosstalk among the activated pathways eventually results in changes in the expression of a number of genes. Part of the pathway was adopted and edited from wikipathway WP85."		10090

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP509	Nuclear Receptors		Nuclear receptors are a class of proteins found within the interior of cells that are responsible for sensing the presence of steroid and thyroid hormones and certain other molecules. In response, these receptors work in concert with other proteins to regulate the expression of specific genes thereby controlling the development, homeostasis, and metabolism of the organism. Nuclear receptors have the ability to directly bind to DNA and regulate the expression of adjacent genes, hence these receptors are classified as transcription factors. The regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptors only happens when a liganda molecule which affects the receptor's behavioris present. More specifically, ligand binding to a nuclear receptor results in a conformational change in the receptor which in turn activates the receptor resulting in up-regulation of gene expression. A unique property of nuclear receptors which differentiate them from other classes of receptors is their ability to directly interact with and control the expression of genomic DNA. Consequently nuclear receptors play key roles in both embryonic development and adult homeostasis.Source: Wikipedia ([[wikipedia:Nuclear_receptor]])		10090

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP5128	Fibrin complement receptor 3 signaling pathway		The blood protein fibrinogen, a key component of the coagulation cascade, has been identified as an early molecular factor triggering inflammation in the brain and periphery (see bibliography). Upon fibrinogen extravasation across leaky vessels (i.e., break down of the blood-brain barrier), fibrinogen is converted by thrombin to insoluble fibrin. Based on published studies, this signaling pathway highlights fibrin as a CD11b/CD18 (complement receptor; CR3) integrin receptor ligand that regulates innate immunity. Fibrin activates central nervous system (CNS) resident microglia and peripheral (bone marrow-derived) macrophages via CR3, leading to intracellular kinase signaling activation including PI3K, AKT1, and RhoA activity that regulates phagocytosis; and NF-κB translocation to the nucleus that transcriptionally regulates proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that recruit T-cells and macrophages. Canonical LPS-TLR4 activation of innate immune cells and potential mechanisms of CD11b transactivation are shown.This pathway has been converted from human to mouse from https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4136.		10090

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP539	Wnt signaling pathway		Wnt family of proteins are a large family of cysteine-rich secreted glycoproteins that regulate cell-cell interactions. They bind to members of the Frizzled family of 7 transmembrane receptors. Binding of Wnt to its receptors leads to activation of at least 3 distinct pathways: i) the canonical beta catenin pathway, ii) the planar cell polarity pathway, and, iii) the calcium pathway. In the canonical beta catenin pathway, binding of Wnt to its receptors leads to stabilization of beta catenin in the cytosol followed by its translocation into the nucleus where it activates the transcription factor Tcf/Lef leading to upregulation of target genes. The non canonical planar cell polarity pathway involves activation of Dishevelled, small G proteins (Rho/Rac) and JNK. The non canonical calcium pathway involves activation of calcium sensitive kinases, PKC and CAMKII by Dishevelled. The Wnt signaling pathway is similar to the Hedgehog pathway in many respects. Abnormalities in the Wnt signaling pathway are associated with a large variety of human malignancies including tumors of breast, colon, pancreas, liver and bone.Source: [http://www.netpath.org/pathways?path_id=NetPath_8 NetPath]'''Additional comments:'''This cancer signaling pathway is available at Cancer Cell Map (http://cancer.cellmap.org) and NetPath (http://www.netpath.org) and is part of a collaborative project between the Computational Biology Center at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (http://cbio.mskcc.org), PandeyLab at Johns Hopkins University (http://pandeylab.igm.jhmi.edu) and Institute of Bioinformatics (http://www.ibioinformatics.org).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP553	Calcium regulation in cardiac cells		Calcium is a common signaling mechanism, as once it enters the cytoplasm it exerts allosteric regulatory affects on many enzymes and proteins. Calcium can act in signal transduction after influx resulting from activation of ion channels or as a second messenger caused by indirect signal transduction pathways such as G protein-coupled receptors. Movement of calcium ions from the extracellular compartment to the intracellular compartment alters membrane depolarisation. This is seen in the heart, during the plateau phase of ventricular contraction. In this example, calcium acts to maintain depolarisation of the heart.Source: [[wikipedia:Calcium_signaling|Wikipedia]]		10090
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP567	Eukaryotic transcription initiation		In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase, and therefore the initiation of transcription, requires the presence of a core promoter sequence in the DNA. RNA polymerase is able to bind to core promoters in the presence of various specific transcription factors. The most common type of core promoter in eukaryotes is a short DNA sequence known as a TATA box. The TATA box, as a core promoter, is the binding site for a transcription factor known as TATA binding protein (TBP), which is itself a subunit of another transcription factor, called Transcription Factor II D (TFIID). After TFIID binds to the TATA box via the TBP, five more transcription factors and RNA polymerase combine around the TATA box in a series of stages to form a preinitiation complex. One transcription factor, DNA helicase, has helicase activity and so is involved in the separating of opposing strands of double-stranded DNA to provide access to a single-stranded DNA template. However, only a low, or basal, rate of transcription is driven by the preinitiation complex alone. Other proteins known as activators and repressors, along with any associated coactivators or corepressors, are responsible for modulating transcription rate.Source: [[wikipedia:Transcription_(genetics)|Wikipedia]]		10090

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP85	Focal adhesion		Cell-matrix adhesions play essential roles in important biological processes including cell motility, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, regulation of gene expression and cell survival. At the cell-extracellular matrix contact points, specialized structures are formed and termed focal adhesions, where bundles of actin filaments are anchored to transmembrane receptors of the integrin family through a multi-molecular complex of junctional plaque proteins. Some of the constituents of focal adhesions participate in the structural link between membrane receptors and the actin cytoskeleton, while others are signaling molecules, including different protein kinases and phosphatases, their substrates, and various adapter proteins. Integrin signaling is dependent upon the non-receptor tyrosine kinase activities of the FAK and src proteins as well as the adaptor protein functions of FAK, src and Shc to initiate downstream signaling events. These signalling events culminate in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton; a prerequisite for changes in cell shape and motility, and gene expression. Similar morphological alterations and modulation of gene expression are initiated by the binding of growth factors to their respective receptors, emphasizing the considerable crosstalk between adhesion- and growth factor-mediated signaling.		10090

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP88	Toll-like receptor signaling		Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of proteins that play a key role in the innate immune system. They are single, membrane-spanning, non-catalytic receptors usually expressed in sentinel cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, that recognize structurally conserved molecules derived from microbes. Once these microbes have breached physical barriers such as the skin or intestinal tract mucosa, they are recognized by TLRs, which activate immune cell responses. The TLRs include TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, TLR10, TLR11, TLR12, and TLR13.TLR signaling is divided into two distinct signaling pathways, the MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent pathway. The MyD88-dependent response occurs on dimerization of the TLR receptor, and is utilized by every TLR except TLR3. Its primary effect is activation of NFκB and Mitogen-activated protein kinase. Ligand binding and conformational change that occurs in the receptor recruits the adaptor protein MyD88, a member of the TIR family. MyD88 then recruits IRAK4, IRAK1 and IRAK2. IRAK kinases then phosphorylate and activate the protein TRAF6, which in turn polyubiquinates the protein TAK1, as well as itself in order to facilitate binding to IKK-β. On binding, TAK1 phosphorylates IKK-β, which then phosphorylates IκB causing its degradation and allowing NFκB to diffuse into the cell nucleus and activate transcription and consequent induction of inflammatory cytokines.Both TLR3 and TLR4 utilize the TRIF-dependent pathway, which is triggered by dsRNA and LPS, respectively. For TLR3, dsRNA leads to activation of the receptor, recruiting the adaptor TRIF. TRIF activates the kinases TBK1 and RIPK1, which creates a branch in the signaling pathway. The TRIF/TBK1 signaling complex phosphorylates IRF3 allowing its translocation into the nucleus and production of Interferon type I. Meanwhile, activation of RIPK1 causes the polyubiquitination and activation of TAK1 and NFκB transcription in the same manner as the MyD88-dependent pathway.Source: Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor#Signaling)		10090

SN-38 is primarily metabolized to the inactive SN-38 glucuronide by UGT1A1, the isoform catalyzing bilirubin glucuronidation. Irinotecan is used in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, small cell lung cancer and several other solid tumors. There is large interpatient variability in response to irinotecan, as well as severe side effects such as diarrhea and neutropenia, which might be explained in part by genetic variation in the metabolic enzymes and transporters depicted here. Well-known variants to effect this pathway are the promoter polymorphic repeat in UGT1A1 (UGT1A1*28) and the 1236C&amp;gt;T polymorphism in ABCB1. While UGT1A1*28 genotype has been associated with toxicity, further evidence is needed to describe the roles of ABCB1 variants in toxicity.Source: [http://www.pharmgkb.org/search/pathway/irinotecan/liver.jsp PharmGkb]		10116
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1276	Glucuronidation		Metabolism of xenobiotic compounds consists of phase I and a phase II biotransformation reactions, being compound modification and conjugation reactions respectively. In phase I biotransformation, the compound is modificated via oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, or other minor reactions, to reveal a reactive group to which a conjugation molecule can react to. In phase II, a small conjugation molecule reacts with the phase I modified molecule, producing a much more water-soluble molecule that can be excreted more easily.Glucuronidation is a phase II biotransformation reaction in which glucuronide acts as a conjugation molecule and binds to a substrate via the catalysis of glucuronosyltransferases. First, in a series of reactions the cosubstrate uridine diphosphate glucuronic acid (UDPGA) is formed. The glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) then catalyze the transfer of glucuronic acid from UDPGA to a substrate resulting in a glucuronidated substrate and leaving uridine 5'-diphosphate. UGTs are a very broad and divers group of enzymes and count as the most significant  group of conjugation enzymes in xenobiotic metabolism, qualitatively because glucuronic acid can be coupled to a large diversity of functional groups and quantitatively because of the large and divers number of substrates that are formed.		10116

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1285	Arachidonate epoxygenase / epoxide hydrolase		The cytochrome P450-dependent formation of polyunsaturated fatty acid epoxides is an important biochemical pathway creating mediators of inflammation and blood pressure regulation.  Once formed these compounds can be incorperated into phospholipid membrance, and released by the action of phospholipase A2.  The epoxides of arachidonic acid, i.e. the epoxyeicosatrieneoic acid or EETs, are putative endothelial derived hyperpolarization factors which increase the open state probability of Ca++ sensitive K+ channels, leading to vasodilation in arteriolar beds.  The 11(12)-EET in particular appears to have potent functions in vasodilation, and are inhibitors of NFKb dependent inflammatory signalling, and PAI-1 activity.  The 5(6)-EET appears unique, in that its metabolic transformation through cyclooxygenase activities produces potent vasoconstrictors.  With the exception of the 5(6)-EET, these epoxy fatty acids are good substrates for the soluble epoxide hydrolase.  Hydrolytic tranformation to vicinal diols eliminates vasoactive actions, however these vicinal diols have been reported to have other biological activites, including PPAR-alpha activation.  Recent development of inhibitors of the soluble epoxide hydrolase are proving to have potent anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, and anti-nociceptive properties.  Reports of enzyme catalyzed glutathione-conjugates of the epoxy fatty acids have been reported, but the activity and relavance of these potential metabolic products are unknown to date.		10116

It is also needed to render non-polar compounds polar so that they are not reabsorbed in renal tubules and are excreted.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1292	One-carbon metabolism		This one-carbon metabolism pathway is centered around folate. Folate has two key carbon-carbon double bonds. Saturating one of them yields dihydrofolate (DHF) and adding an additional molecule of hydrogen across the second yields tetrahydrofolate (THF). Folates serve as donors of single carbons in any one of three oxidation states: 5-methyl-THF (CH3THF; reduced), 5,10 methylene-THF (CH2THF; intermediate) and 10-formyl-THF (CHOTHF; oxidized). The single carbon donor CH3THF is used to convert homocysteine into methionine which can then be used to methylate DNA, the donor CH2THF is used (along with a molecule of hydrogen at the site of one of the double bonds) to convert dUMP (deoxyuridylate) into dTMP (thymidylate) and the donor CHOTHF is used to set up ring closure reactions in de novo purine synthesis. CH3THF is the primary methyl-group donor for processes such as DNA methylation reactions. Purines are used both in RNA synthesis and in DNA synthesis and dTMP is synthesized srtictly for DNA synthesis, be it for DNA repair or DNA replication.The folate pathway is central to any study related to DNA methylation, dTMP synthesis or purine synthesis.Differential methylation (e.g. hypermethylation of tumor suppressors) as well as disturbances in nucleotide synthesis and repair, are associated with several forms of cancer. There are also indications that hypermethylation is involved in the progression of adenomas to cancer.		10116

In mice loss of signaling by any member of the ErbB family results in embryonic lethality with defects in organs including the lungs, skin, heart and brain. Excessive ErbB signaling is associated with the development of a wide variety of types of solid tumor. ErbB-1 and ErbB-2 are found in many human cancers and their excessive signaling may be critical factors in the development and malignancy of these tumors.The ErbB protein family consists of 4 members    * ErbB-1, also named epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)    * ErbB-2, also named HER2 in humans and neu in rodents    * ErbB-3, also named HER3 and    * ErbB-4, also named HER4The four members of the ErbB protein family are capable of forming homodimers, heterodimers, and possibly higher order oligomers upon activation by a subset of potential growth factor ligands.		10116

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP135	IL-6 signaling pathway		IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine with important role in immune regulation, hematopoiesis, inflammation and oncogenesis. IL-6-type cytokines exert their action via the signal transducer gp130 that associates with IL6R in a cooperative manner to form a hexameric signal transducing complex, capable of activating the down stream mediators of this signaling pathway. This mechanism of signal transduction is shared by other members of the IL-6 type cytokines like IL-11, leukaemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor and cardiotrophin-1 that use gp130 as a common subunit of the signal transducing complex. IL-6 stimulation leads to the activation of JAK/STAT pathway. Both STAT1 and STAT3 are phosphorylated and are able to form homo- and heterodimers after activation leading to their nuclear localization and subsequent regulation of transcription of respective target genes. SHP-2 is one of the ubiquitous tyrosine phosphatases and IL-6 stimulation leads to the SHP2-dependent activation of MAPKs, it also links the Grb2-SOS complex and Gab1 to gp130. Phosphorylated Gab1 acts as an adapter and is involved in the indirect association of SHP-2 and PI-3 kinase. Downstream activation of Vav1, Rac-1 and MAP2K4 is necessary for the IL-6-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation and transactivation to accomplish its effects. STAT3 is also phosphorylated by PKCD and it causes inhibition of STAT3 DNA binding and transcriptional activity. PTPN11 and SOCS3 exert inhibitory function and thus lead to down regulation of the signaling cascade.		10116

However, further studies have led to the identification of lipid ligands for some of these adopted orphan receptors, which are responsible for lipid metabolism, storage or elimination. One of the characteristics of these receptors is that they act by forming heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR). The receptors include peroxisome proliferators-Activated receptors (PPARs) for fatty acids, liver X receptor (LCR) for oxysterols, Farnesoid X receptors (FXR) for bile acids and steroid xenobiotic receptor/X receptor (SXR/PXR or Nsil2) for xenobiotics. Other orphan receptors also require RXR for its functions are vitamin D receptor (VDR) for vitamin D and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) for retinoid acids, although these receptors are not involved in lipid metabolism. Upon binding to various ligands, three classes of proteins are synthesized including lipid binding proteins, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and cytochrome P450 member proteins which catalyzes lipid anabolism, metabolism and elimination.In addition to lipid metabolism, some members of the cytochrome P450 family genes are responsible for activation of procarcinogens, detoxification of environmental toxins and metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics. In particular, CAR, Nsil2 and recently identified VDR are important in up-regulation of these cytochromes. Of all the human cytochrome P450 genes, only a few CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 account for most toxicity effects, specifically CYP3A is responsible for clearing approximately half of the clinically prescribed drugs. For instance, acetaminophen, one of the most commonly used drug, is toxic in high doses due to the activation of CAR and the drugs subsequent conversion to acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) by CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and CYP3A.		10116
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP140	Myometrial relaxation and contraction pathways		This pathway illustrates signaling networks implicated in uterine muscle contraction at labor and quiescence throughout gestation (pregnancy). The muscle of the uterus, responsible for contractile activity is the myometrium. Genes in this pathway are either transcribed in myometrial muscle cells or act upon the myometrium to regulate contraction. The left half of this pathway illustrates pathways of myometrial relaxation that are active throughout normal gestation. These signaling events act to suppress coordinated contractions to prevent the early onset of labor at term, largely via activation of the adenylyl-cyclase thrhough G-protein coupled receptors. On the right side of this pathway are signaling componets involved in the activation of uterine contractions at labor, in particular, activation of calcium mobilization via Oxytocin mediated binding to the Oxytocin G-protein coupled receptor. Additional genes implicated in this pathway, based on microarray expression profiling of gestation, term and postpartum of term mice are also included (e.g., Guca2b, Rdc1, Edg2) have also been included.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1485	Interactions between CFTR and other ion channels		The CFTR receptor (an ion channel, which transports CL- out of the cell) can form a complex with CFTR assiciated protein (CAL), followed by degradation. If NHERF1 is present it will form a complex with the CFTR receptor (by binding the PDZ1 region), inhibiting degradation. This complex will bind to other proteins / ion channels. One of these ion channels is the Slc26 family, which binds to the PDZ2 region of NHERF1. After forming this complex  Cl- and NaHCO3 secretion will be performed.The same thing happens with the ENaC (an ion channel, which transports Na+), which consists of 3 subunits (alfa, beta & gamma). This channels binds YES-accosiated protein (YAP), which in his turn binds the PDZ2 region of NHERF1. Also c-YES will bind to NHERF1, which inhibits the ENaC channel. By forming this complex Cl- secretion will be induced, while Na+ absorption will be reduced.		10116

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP1491	PI3K-AKT-NFkB pathway		NFKB is an important transcription factor induced by multiple cellular mechanisms. This pathway diagram depicts the major activators of the pathway and the downsteam genes regulated by the pathway. Activation of growth factor receptors by growth factors or cellular stress leads to the activation of the Phosphatidyl Inositol-3 kinases (PI3Kinases). PI3 kinases phosphorylate the inositol ring of Phosphatidyl inositol to produce Phosphatidyl inositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 activates downstream serine-threonine protein kinases such as Protein kinase B (AKT/PKB) through the kinase PDK1. Activation of Akt is tightly regulated by the quantity of the second messenger phosphatidyl inositol triphosphate.(PIP3). AKT itself can be dephosphorylated by the action of protein phosphatases. AKT contributes to several cellular functions including inhibition of apoptosis and cell survival, nutrient metabolism, cell growth, transcriptional regulation. AKT inhibits apoptosis by the phosphorylated inhibition of BAD and caspase 9. AKT phosphorylates and inactivates the enzyme glycogen synthetase kinase 3 and activates the transcription of glucose transporter (GLUT 1) and the glycolytic enzyme Phospho-fructo-2-kinase. AKT activates the NFΚΒ pathway through direct activation of IΚK and through phosphorylation of the MAP3kinase Tpl2. Activation of the NFΚΒ pathway also occurs through trans-membrane receptor complexes (TNF receptor superfamily, IL-1 receptor and the Toll like receptor family). Hypoxia, reactive oxygen species and cytokines such as TNF alpha and IL-1 activate the NFΚΒ pathway through these receptors. NFΚΒ elements are usually present in the cytoplasm as homo or heterodimers. They are localised to the cytoplasm by being complexed to proteins called the Inhibitors of Kappa beta (IΚΒ). Activation of the NFΚΒ pathway involves the breakdown of these complexes by proteosomal degradation of the IΚΒ subunits and translocation of the NFΚΒ elements into the nucleus. This is catalyzed by the action of protein kinases called the inhibitors of kappa kinase (IΚK) complex. In the nucleus NFΚΒ elements induce the transcription of genes related to cytokines, cell surface receptors, pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins, adhesion molecules and anti-oxidants. NFΚΒ pathway is regulated by several feedback loops including increased transcription of the Iκβε gene in response to NFΚΒ activation.		10116

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP160	Glycogen metabolism		"Glycogen is a very large, branched polymer of glucose residues. Within skeletal muscle and liver glucose is stored as glycogen. In the liver, glycogen synthesis and degradation are regulated to maintain blood-glucose levels as required to meet the needs of the organism as a whole. In contrast, in muscle, these processes are regulated to meet the energy needs of the muscle itself. '''Glycogen synthesis''' is, unlike its breakdown, endergonic. This means that glycogen synthesis requires the input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from UTP, which reacts with glucose-1-phosphate, forming UDP-glucose, in reaction catalyzed by UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDP-glucose by the enzyme glycogen synthase, which progressively lengthens the glycogen chain with (a1->4) bonded glucose. As glycogen synthase can only lengthen an existing chain, the protein glycogenin is needed to initiate the synthesis of glycogen. The glycogen-branching enzyme, amylo (a1->4) to (a1->6) transglycosylase, catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of 6-7 glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.'''Glycogen degradation''' consists of three steps: (1) the release of glucose 1-phosphate from glycogen, (2) the remodeling of the glycogen substrate to permit further degradation, and (3) the conversion of glucose 1-phosphate into glucose 6-phosphate for further metabolism.Information partly derived from ""Biochemistry"" by Stryer and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen Wikipedia]."		10116

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP188	Focal adhesion		Cell-matrix adhesions play essential roles in important biological processes including cell motility, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, regulation of gene expression and cell survival. At the cell-extracellular matrix contact points, specialized structures are formed and termed focal adhesions, where bundles of actin filaments are anchored to transmembrane receptors of the integrin family through a multi-molecular complex of junctional plaque proteins. Some of the constituents of focal adhesions participate in the structural link between membrane receptors and the actin cytoskeleton, while others are signalling molecules, including different protein kinases and phosphatases, their substrates, and various adapter proteins. Integrin signaling is dependent upon the non-receptor tyrosine kinase activities of the FAK and src proteins as well as the adaptor protein functions of FAK, src and Shc to initiate downstream signaling events. These signalling events culminate in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton; a prerequisite for changes in cell shape and motility, and gene expression. Similar morphological alterations and modulation of gene expression are initiated by the binding of growth factors to their respective receptors, emphasizing the considerable crosstalk between adhesion- and growth factor-mediated signalling.		10116

The Notch receptors are expressed on the cell surface as heterodimeric proteins and their ligands are also membrane-bound. Signaling through the Notch receptors is triggered by ligand-binding that induces cleavage of the extracellular domain by an ADAM family metalloprotease followed by a cleavage within the transmembrane domain by gamma secretase complex. The second cleavage leads to translocation of the cytosolic domain of Notch receptors into the nucleus. Notch proteins are important in lineage specification and stem cell maintenance. Aberrant Notch signaling has been linked to a number of malignancies including leukemias, lymphomas and carcinomas of the breast, skin, lung, cervix and kidneys.Source: NetPath http://www.netpath.org/pathways?path_id=NetPath_3		10116

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP217	Nuclear receptors		Nuclear receptors are a class of proteins found within the interior of cells that are responsible for sensing the presence of steroid and thyroid hormones and certain other molecules. In response, these receptors work in concert with other proteins to regulate the expression of specific genes thereby controlling the development, homeostasis, and metabolism of the organism. Nuclear receptors have the ability to directly bind to DNA and regulate the expression of adjacent genes, hence these receptors are classified as transcription factors. The regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptors only happens when a liganda molecule which affects the receptor's behavioris present. More specifically, ligand binding to a nuclear receptor results in a conformational change in the receptor which in turn activates the receptor resulting in up-regulation of gene expression. A unique property of nuclear receptors which differentiate them from other classes of receptors is their ability to directly interact with and control the expression of genomic DNA. Consequently nuclear receptors play key roles in both embryonic development and adult homeostasis.Source: Wikipedia ([[wikipedia:Nuclear_receptor]])		10116

Nfe2l2 plays a critical role in regulating redox homeostasis, differentiation, and maturation by modulating the expression of cytoprotective genes like Hmox1, Nqo1, and glutathione. Nfe2l2 is involved in various cellular functions, including differentiation, proliferation, and inflammation, by promoting antioxidative gene expression, suppressing the production of reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines, and inhibiting Nfkb signaling.

Within 24 hours, chemoattractants  and cytokines released from the site of injury activate neutrophils which further recruit B and T cells or recruit monocytes that ultimately result in infiltration and activation by microglia and macrophages. These immune responses result in inflammation, excitotoxicity, cell death, formation of glial scar, and suppression of axonal regeneration.

Each MAPKK, however, can be activated by more than one MAPKKK, increasing the complexity and diversity of MAPK signalling. Presumably each MAPKKK confers responsiveness to distinct stimuli. For example, activation of ERK1/2 by growth factors depends on the MAPKKK c-Raf, but other MAPKKKs may activate ERK1/2 in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli.Source: KEGG http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway:map04010		10116

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP375	Wnt signaling pathway		Wnt family of proteins are a large family of cysteine-rich secreted glycoproteins that regulate cell-cell interactions. They bind to members of the Frizzled family of 7 transmembrane receptors. Binding of Wnt to its receptors leads to activation of at least 3 distinct pathways: i) the canonical beta catenin pathway, ii) the planar cell polarity pathway, and, iii) the calcium pathway. In the canonical beta catenin pathway, binding of Wnt to its receptors leads to stabilization of beta catenin in the cytosol followed by its translocation into the nucleus where it activates the transcription factor Tcf/Lef leading to upregulation of target genes. The non canonical planar cell polarity pathway involves activation of Dishevelled, small G proteins (Rho/Rac) and JNK. The non canonical calcium pathway involves activation of calcium sensitive kinases, PKC and CAMKII by Dishevelled. The Wnt signaling pathway is similar to the Hedgehog pathway in many respects. Abnormalities in the Wnt signaling pathway are associated with a large variety of human malignancies including tumors of breast, colon, pancreas, liver and bone.Source: [http://www.netpath.org/pathways?path_id=NetPath_8 NetPath]'''Additional comments:'''This cancer signaling pathway is available at Cancer Cell Map (http://cancer.cellmap.org) and NetPath (http://www.netpath.org) and is part of a collaborative project between the Computational Biology Center at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (http://cbio.mskcc.org), PandeyLab at Johns Hopkins University (http://pandeylab.igm.jhmi.edu) and Institute of Bioinformatics (http://www.ibioinformatics.org).

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP3894	Fructose metabolism in proximal tubules		Most of the fructose absorbed in the gut is cleared in its first hepatic passage; however, under certain conditions, such as ingestion of large amounts of free fructose, the sugar can reach high levels in plasma and filtrate through the glomeruli. Filtered fructose is reabsorbed by proximal tubule cells. Ingestion of large quantities of free fructose, usually from high fructose corn syrup, has been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and elevated blood pressure.  Salt-sensitivity of blood pressure in rodents receiving 10 or 20% fructose solutions is well documented. Sensitivity to salt, should include a renal defect, otherwise pressure natriuretis would restore Na balance. Since the bulk of fructose and other sugars are absorbed in proximal tubules, it is believed that fructose affect this nephron segment first. This pathway features the metabolism of fructose in proximal tubule cells. It was created using biochemical data showing metabolites accumulation and enzymatic activities in proximal tubules challenged with fructose. Also deep sequencing data from microdissected renal proximal tubules was used to confirm the presence of the transcript of the enzymes. Gene transcripts are annotated using ENTREZ Gene ID.		10116

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP491	Eukaryotic transcription initiation		In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase, and therefore the initiation of transcription, requires the presence of a core promoter sequence in the DNA. RNA polymerase is able to bind to core promoters in the presence of various specific transcription factors. The most common type of core promoter in eukaryotes is a short DNA sequence known as a TATA box. The TATA box, as a core promoter, is the binding site for a transcription factor known as TATA binding protein (TBP), which is itself a subunit of another transcription factor, called Transcription Factor II D (TFIID). After TFIID binds to the TATA box via the TBP, five more transcription factors and RNA polymerase combine around the TATA box in a series of stages to form a preinitiation complex. One transcription factor, DNA helicase, has helicase activity and so is involved in the separating of opposing strands of double-stranded DNA to provide access to a single-stranded DNA template. However, only a low, or basal, rate of transcription is driven by the preinitiation complex alone. Other proteins known as activators and repressors, along with any associated coactivators or corepressors, are responsible for modulating transcription rate.Source: [[wikipedia:Transcription_(genetics)|Wikipedia]]		10116

In spite of the wide range of cellular processes that the TGF&amp;#x3b2; signaling pathway regulates, the process is relatively simple. TGF&amp;#x3b2; superfamily ligands bind to a type II receptor, which recruits and phosphorylates a type I receptor. The type I receptor then phosphorylates receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs) which can now bind the coSMAD SMAD4. R-SMAD/coSMAD complexes accumulate in the nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the regulation of target gene expression.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP517	Notch signaling pathway		The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved, intercellular signaling mechanism essential for proper embryonic development in all metazoan organisms in the Animal kingdom. The Notch proteins (Notch1-Notch4 in vertebrates) are single-pass receptors that are activated by the Delta (or Delta-like) and Jagged/Serrate families of membrane-bound ligands. They are transported to the plasma membrane as cleaved, but otherwise intact polypeptides. Interaction with ligand leads to two additional proteolytic cleavages that liberate the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the plasma membrane. The NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with the DNA binding protein CSL, displacing a histone deacetylase (HDAc)-co-repressor (CoR) complex from CSL. Components of an activation complex, such as MAML1 and histone acetyltransferases (HATs), are recruited to the NICD-CSL complex, leading to the transcriptional activation of Notch target genes.		10116

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP529	mRNA processing		This process describes the conversion of precursor messenger RNA into mature messenger RNA (mRNA). The pre-mRNA molecule undergoes three main modifications. These modifications are 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and RNA splicing, which occur in the cell nucleus before the RNA is translated.5' Capping: Capping of the pre-mRNA involves the addition of 7-methylguanosine (m7G) to the 5' end. The cap protects the 5' end of the primary RNA transcript from attack by ribonucleases that have specificity to the 3'5' phosphodiester bonds.3' Processing: The pre-mRNA processing at the 3' end of the RNA molecule involves cleavage of its 3' end and then the addition of about 200 adenine residues to form a poly(A) tail. As the poly(A) tails is synthesised, it binds multiple copies of poly(A) binding protein, which protects the 3'end from ribonuclease digestion.Splicing: RNA splicing is the process by which introns, regions of RNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule.

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP547	Complement and coagulation cascades		The complement system is a proteolytic cascade in blood plasma and a mediator of innate immunity, a nonspecific defense mechanism against pathogens. There are three pathways of complement activation: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. All of these pathways generate a crucial enzymatic activity that, in turn, generates the effector molecules of complement. The main consequences of complement activation are the opsonization of pathogens, the recruitment of inflammatory and immunocompetent cells, and the direct killing of pathogens. Blood coagulation is another series of proenzyme-to-serine protease conversions, culminating the formation of thrombin, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of soluble fibrinogen to the insoluble fibrin clot. Protease-activated receptors, such as those activated by thrombin, are members of G protein-coupled receptors and function as a mediator of innate immunity. The kallikrein-kinin system is an endogenous metabolic cascade, triggering of which results in the release of vasoactive kinins (bradykinin-related peptides). Kinin peptides are implicated in many physiological and pathological processes including the regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis, inflammatory processes, and the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning.Source: [http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway:map04610 KEGG]		10116

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP564	Wnt signaling pathway		Wnt proteins are secreted morphogens that are required for basic developmental processes, such as cell-fate specification, progenitor-cell proliferation and the control of asymmetric cell division, in many different species and organs. There are at least three different Wnt pathways: the canonical pathway, the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway and the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway. In the canonical Wnt pathway, the major effect of Wnt ligand binding to its receptor is the stabilization of cytoplasmic beta-catenin through inhibition of the bea-catenin degradation complex. Beta-catenin is then free to enter the nucleus and activate Wnt-regulated genes through its interaction with TCF (T-cell factor) family transcription factors and concomitant recruitment of coactivators. Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling leads to the activation of the small GTPases RHOA (RAS homologue gene-family member A) and RAC1, which activate the stress kinase JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase) and ROCK (RHO-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1) and leads to remodelling of the cytoskeleton and changes in cell adhesion and motility. WNT-Ca2+ signalling is mediated through G proteins and phospholipases and leads to transient increases in cytoplasmic free calcium that subsequently activate the kinase PKC (protein kinase C) and CAMKII (calcium calmodulin mediated kinase II) and the phosphatase calcineurin.Source: [http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/hsa/hsa04310.html KEGG].		10116
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP569	IL-2 signaling pathway		IL-2 is a multifunctional cytokine with pleiotropic effects on several cells of the immune system. IL-2 was originally discovered as a T cell growth factor, but it was also found to have actions related to B cell proliferation, and cytolytic activity of natural killer cells. IL-2 also activates lymphokine activated killer cells. In contrast to its proliferative effects, IL-2 also has potent activity in a process known as activation-induced cell death. More recently, IL-2 was shown to promote tolerance through its effects on regulatory T cell development. IL-2 clinically has anti-cancer effects as well as utility in supporting T cell numbers in HIV/AIDS. There are three classes of IL-2 receptors, binding IL-2 with low, intermediate, or high-affinity. The low affinity receptor (IL-2Rα alone) is not functional; signaling by IL-2 involves either the high affinity hetero-trimeric receptor containing IL-2Rα, IL-2Rβ and the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (originally named IL-2Rγ and now generally denoted as γc) or the intermediate affinity heterodimeric receptor composed of IL-2Rβ and γc. IL-2 stimulation induces the activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK3, which associate with IL-2Rβ and γc, respectively. These kinases in turn phosphorylate IL-2Rβ and induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) and various other downstream targets. The downstream signaling pathways activated by IL-2 also involves mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling modules, leading to both mitogenic and anti-apoptotic signals.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_2_pathway.html NetSlim] database.

Stimulation of the receptor activates the SMAD signaling module.Source: http://www.netpath.org/pathways?path_id=NetPath_2		10116
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP73	G protein signaling pathways		"G proteins, short for guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, are a family of proteins involved in second messenger cascades.G proteins are so called because they function as ""molecular switches"". They alternate from 'inactive' guanosine diphosphate (GDP) to 'active' guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which is a binding state, and which proceeds to regulate downstream cell processes.Source: [[wikipedia:G_protein|Wikipedia]]"		10116
WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP74	Integrin-mediated cell adhesion		Integrins are receptors that mediate attachment between a cell and the tissues surrounding it, which may be other cells or the extracellular matrix (ECM). They also play a role in cell signaling and thereby define cellular shape, mobility, and regulate the cell cycle.Source: [[wikipedia:Integrins|Wikipedia]]		10116

WikiPathways	Pathway	WikiPathways:WP86	Heme biosynthesis		The enzymatic process that produces heme is properly called porphyrin synthesis, as all the intermediates are tetrapyrroles that are chemically classified are porphyrins. The process is highly conserved across biology. In humans, this pathway serves almost exclusively to form heme. In other species, it also produces similar substances such as cobalamin (vitamin B12).The pathway is initiated by the synthesis of D-Aminolevulinic acid (dALA or δALA) from the amino acid glycine and succinyl-CoA from the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle). The rate-limiting enzyme responsible for this reaction, ALA synthase, is strictly regulated by intracellular iron levels and heme concentration. A low-iron level, e.g., in iron deficiency, leads to decreased porphyrin synthesis, which prevents accumulation of the toxic intermediates. This mechanism is of therapeutic importance: infusion of heme arginate or hematin can abort attacks of porphyria in patients with an inborn error of metabolism of this process, by reducing transcription of ALA synthase.The organs mainly involved in heme synthesis are the liver and the bone marrow, although every cell requires heme to function properly. Heme is seen as an intermediate molecule in catabolism of haemoglobin in the process of bilirubin metabolism.Source: Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heme		10116
